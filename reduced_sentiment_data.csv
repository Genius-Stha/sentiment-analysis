I had hoped that Havahart's Critter Ridder would keep them all at bay, particularly the groundhogs.<br /><br />This product cannot be used on vegetable or fruit gardens/plants.  Although I knew that going in, I decided that I could outline the perimeter of those areas to discourage critter trespassing.  I also had newly planted areas of my property where the deer had nibbled, and I wanted to see if this would keep them out so I didn't have to spray the actual leaves of those delicate, new plants.  Last, I had clear entry points to my property where the deer and groundhogs entered and left, and I wanted to encourage them to find other ways, hopefully onto someone else's property.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the Critter Ridder did nothing to discourage the chipmunks that had already moved into my vegetable garden.  It also did not discourage new animals from visiting.  Veggies must be too tempting to let the scent of Critter Ridder drive them away.  I had much better results around my newly planted areas.  My guess is that this product works best first thing in the spring, before animals have a chance to establish their routines and favorite feeding grounds.<br /><br />The product smells like black pepper when first applied, and then dissipates in a day or so.  Animals supposedly can still smell it.  This 5-pound container doesn't go far, unfortunately, because it must be reapplied after heavy rain.  For those of us with larger properties, one container doesn't begin to cover the perimeter of garden beds and property lines.  I wonder if a large container of ground black pepper would work just as well -- and that could be used in vegetable gardens without toxic results.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"

I don't know if I got a bad batch but the smell of the creamy cheese when I began mixing it with the hot pasta was so foul and nasty I had to open the kitchen windows to clear the stench out of the house. Mind you we're in MA with over 6' of snow right now piled everywhere and filling every nook and cranny available and minus temps and wind chills so believe me, I wouldn't have opened the windows and propped the back door open to get rid of the smell if it wasn't absolutely necessary.<br /><br />I remember having this as a kid, both powdered and creamy cheese but I sure don't recall it having a smell like this. It ruined all our appetites. Because the smell lingered throughout the house, we ended up leaving the house for a while and going out to eat after riding in the open air to clear our nostils. Terrible experience. I was thinking of keeping the remainder of the first order and making it when no one else is home to give to the 5 dogs, but on second thought, if it is a bad batch, I certainly don't want to feed it to my 4-legged babies. Out in the trash it goes and the S&S order canceled.<br /><br />Must admit I'm disappointed.

I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea ""leaves"" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.

At 54% cocoa solids, it's just over the edge of dark chocolate.  So it makes a nice change for those wanting dark chocolate that isn't so dark.

The Newman's Own Dark Chocolate compared well to other premium and organic chocolate we had. It's decidedly darker, less sweet and firmer than a milk chocolate, with a very nice texture both to chew and on the tongue.  And it has some really nice subtleties to the flavor.

So it's a good option that might just hit the (bitter)sweet spot you are looking for in chocolate.<br /><br />PRICE:  These bars are relatively expensive.  That's to be expected for a premium chocolate that's organically produced.  We're lucky enough to have a lot of options for locally for organic chocolate.  Newman's Own is an excellent product, but you will want to compare it to the other options available to you.<br /><br />PRODUCTION: There are two important aspects that make this chocolate as guilt-free as chocolate gets:<br /><br />First, organic production.  Newman's Own has one of the largest organic chocolate sourcing operations in the world, which is highly commendable.  So you and your family get great tasting chocolate without consuming other things you don't want to eat; and, you also get the knowledge that the producers are working to minimize the impact of your consumption on the places where the chocolate is grown.<br /><br />Second, responsible sourcing.  Far too few people know that most of the world's cocoa production is tainted by child labor and often forced labor - or, in plain terms, slavery.  If that's news to you, Google chocolate slavery for some eye-opening information.  Or have a look at some of the Amazon listings, such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GAN1VQ"">Bitter Chocolate: The Dark Side of the World's Most Seductive Sweet</a>.<br /><br />All of that is a lot to fit into a chocolate bar - but Newman's Own has done that, and more, and offers you a lot of excellent options in chocolate.  If this one doesn't suit you, there are several more on Amazon."

Even the largest size Everlasting Ball fits entirely in his jaws and he figured out pretty quickly that if he crunches down the treats just fall out. I tried it with the treats you have to screw in to see if it made it more difficult and had the same results. He finishes off the disks and ignores the toy in less than 5 minutes. Total waste for him.<br /><br />However, this toy has been a godsend for my Alaskan Klee Kai (8lbs). When she had a broken leg and was on bed rest for months this toy really helped out and would occupy her for days.

410496,B000P49A1Q,A324OXU5GNFLII,Nicholas j atlas,5,5,3,1296950400,OK if you can't have the real thing,"After reading the rave reviews on the product website, I decided to spend the cash to try it out. The price tag is pretty steep, coming out to about $3.75 per bar. Pricey, but not insane for decent chocolate. Add to that the fact that you can't buy just one to try it and it makes for a significant investment in something you may or may not like.<br /><br />First of all, after I ordered I looked more closely at the ingredients list. Imagine my surprise when I found no difference in ingredients between the ""milk"" chocolate bars (which contained no milk) and the dark chocolate bars. I looked up the sweeteners they use and found that the claims of the ChocoPerfection bars' makers were true. They don't have most of the downsides of the sugar alcohols that most sugar free chocolate is made with. It also is high in fiber. In fact, one should really be careful with these bars as each one has 14g of fiber. If you eat two, you *will* feel it. The downside of this sweetener is that oligofructose is only about 60% as sweet as sugar. This really shows in the flavor of the chocolate.<br /><br />The candy tasted OK. Not fantastic, but edible, with a fair resemblance to actual chocolate. It didn't have the same sweetness as even normal dark chocolate does, but still tasted fairly right. It did have a slightly odd, though not entirely unpleasant under- and after-taste that might be off-putting to some. I found this to be not too bad. Another oddness is the texture. While at first the texture seems like normal chocolate, it doesn't melt or fragment quite the same way that regular chocolate does and has a somewhat unusual mouth feel. Again, I found this tolerable, but many might not.<br /><br />Would I buy them again? Overall, I'd buy them again if they were a bit cheaper or more easily available. I'd buy one occasionally in the store, if they were available that way. I wouldn't snub one if it was offered to me. All that said, I don't think I'd invest another $50 into a batch of these."

As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas).

If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a ""healthy"" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision.

Split it open and drizzle olive oil (a little fat helps you absorb the vitamins in the sweet potato - high quality olive oil tastes best) and place a chipotle bouillon cube inside. Mash it up thoroughly inside the skin with a fork. Aside from the level of sodium, which you can adjust based on how much of the cube you want to use, this is a pretty healthy snack, and tastes incredible! (kind of like gourmet sweet potato fries) The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I cannot vouch for the healthiness of the cube or what it's made from, but I can tell you this makes for some serious deliciousness!"

It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice."

Aerogrow guarantees the bulbs for six months (which, by the way is their recommended lifespan), so they sent me a new pair.<br /><br />Now on to the garden products themselves. Don't get me wrong, they all tasted the way they were supposed to, but there wasn't the intensity I would normally get from something grown in the ground. I was hoping that the nutrients that come with every kit would provide the elements needed for the flavor. They didn't.<br /><br />Since then, I've also tried the cherry tomatoes and the salad greens.

But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.

It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  There are some great suggestions mentioned by other reviewers, like mint for example."

I tried the other flavors of Lipton in the bottle that were nowhere near as good and even other brands of green tea that never did it for me. This stuff has the perfect light flavor with that twist of lemon and tang of honey. It's just an incredibly refreshing mix, but kind of expensive at 1.49 a bottle.  I tried to save money by making my own green tea using the Lipton green tea bags and sugar and adding my own honey and lemon. Too much work and didn't taste quite the same. I then tried to buy the bottles in bulk, but could never find a supplier. And then for almost two years I couldn't find it at all. I feared they had taken this flavor off the market and replaced it with that terrible Lipton green tea with citrus in the plastic bottles. So when I found it again in the glass bottles last year, I jumped for joy and started drinking it again even at the ridiculous premium I had to pay. And then last week I saw this can in the store. I immediately picked it up and looked at the ingredient list: Sugar, citric acid, honey and lemon just like the stuff in the bottle. I bought it, took it home , mixed it up, and finally I had my tea at a reasonable price!! I can mix up like 20 bottles of this stuff with one can at like 30 cents a bottle. I'm saving like 25 bucks on every full can I use. Needless to say, I'm stocking up on this stuff."

So, I had hoped there was quite a bit of broccoli flavor in these boxes.  What I got instead was all ""flavor"" and not much broccoli at all.  There are two packets and one has about 1-2 tablespoons of dehydrated broccoli and the other has a flavoring that slightly smells like broccoli but mostly just seems salty.  The kraft macaroni / noodle product is pretty much exactly like Kraft Deluxe thought the noodles may be slightly different shaped.  You get a packet of liquid Kraft cheese and this to me is way too salty, seems just like canned nacho cheese dip.  I think the powdered cheese packets they offer in standard mac & cheese boxes have more flavor and seem to taste less salty.  I found that for the money, I could just as easily buy boxed mac & cheese (any flavor including organic or whole wheat) and add frozen chopped broccoli (which usually comes in a very large bag for just a buck or two).  Considering this box assumes you will add grocery bought chicken anyway, you could just as easily buy broccoli as well.  The extra cost of this box just for the small amount of dehydrated broccoli is not necessary.  I found that I could eat healthier & cheaper for the same cooking time by buying these products seperately, hopefully this will help your decision making."

I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.

The bamboo shoots have an interesting texture but they are tasteless.  They derive taste from the curry.  For baby corns, you have to fish for them.  I counted five to six pieces of fragments, each for ¼ inch to 3/8 inch long.  They have the texture of dried wood.  The can was labeled 15.4-oz net weight; I estimate that more than 2/3 of it is the watery curry.  It is mildly sweet from the coconut milk and has a pleasant curry favor.  I poured the curry over macaroni and it made a good eat.  Overall, this green curry is okay but not what I expected."

People were saying that they are the best ever and better than Haribo. They were also cheaper than Haribo. So I decided to try them.<br /><br />They are softer than Haribo Gummi Bears. I think the Haribo gummy bears have a unique and very satisfying chew to them. Even softer Haribo candies such as the Peaches have a kind of thickness, a satisfying solidity to them. If you feel like me, you may not like the texture of the Albanese bears as much, as they are softer. On the other hand, I've heard some people say of the Haribo bears that they taste like plastic (due to the texture). These people may like the Albanese bears better. Biting through the Albanese brand bears, I guess the word I'd describe the texture might be ""smooth"" or ""satiney""<br /><br />Since the Albanese brand bears mentioned several times that they had so many flavors, I was expecting unique and distinct flavors, in the way that Jelly Belly jelly beans are different and unique. These Albanese bears are not like that. While there are different flavors, it's not clear exactly what each flavor is supposed to be. The flavors seem to all kind of run together, even after you eat one color at a time.<br /><br />Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed, especially considering how so many reviews of this candy proclaimed it as being the ""omg best ever"" and ""world's best"" and ""better than Haribo"". While it is a good candy, these are gross overstatements and it makes me wonder how many of these glowing reviews are shill reviews placed by the manufacturer.<br /><br />TL;DR: Not as good as Haribo. Cheaper than Haribo. Better than generic store brand. Flavors not as distinct as expected based on advertising. Certainly not ""best ever"", despite the claims of some somewhat questionable reviews."

I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I ""transitioned"" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of ""transitioning"" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.

I came across this cereal at Whole Foods and even though it was more money then I wanted to spend I thought that it sounded very good.  I went in thinking that I was going to get something similar to froot loops but this cereal is nothing like them.  I cant stress enough that if you want to try this cereal dont go into thinking you are going to get a healthy version of froot loops, this cereal is in its own category.  The best way I think I can describe what this cereal is simpilar to would be the taste is more like Trix only not as sweet or flavorful, and they have the consistancy of Honey nut cherrios but much crunchier.  They are so crunchy that it is almost bothersome, to me anyways.  They dont get soggy in milk and are very filling for just 3/4 of a cup.  I couldnt really taste one fruit flavor over the other, to be honest I cant detect any fruit flavor when eating this.  I will not be purchasing it again but I can imagine that children would like to snack on this.  I will be giving this to my newphew, I am sure he will like it."

I make all of his fruit and vegetable baby food myself but I was a little overwhelmed at trying to do the meat ones.  I wanted to buy all organic but I live in a very small town and didn't want to mess with trying to find the closest place to get organic/hormone free/antibiotic free meat.

If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a ""healthy"" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision.

I didn't taste any cinnamon at all and the icing on the mini-wheats doesn't taste like any cinnamon roll topping I've ever had. I've had ones from organic co-ops to Pillsbury DoughBoy encrusted ones. This just tasted...odd and unpleasant to me. After finishing a bowl, I realized that it tasted like my rabbit's hairball medicine smelled. molasses and malt. Sure enough, malt flavoring is the main ingredient in the icing. As such it was hard to want to take eat any more after the mental picture of me gulping down Laxatone developed. On the plus side, my rabbits REALLY wanted this cereal. It's pretty close to what they eat anyway.<br /><br />My wife liked the cereal however, She didn't think it tasted like cinnamon rolls, but she found the taste pleasing. As such the cereal was one for two in my household and so it gets a thumb's in the middle here. One last note though, each serving is 47 grams of carbs. That's pretty impressive."

After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I followed the directions closely, including looking up what 3 oz. of water is so that I could measure correctly.  I made sure to drain out the excess water and put the whole thing on top of my refrigerator (the only place my cat hasn't figured out how to get to).  The first sprout that came up looked like it had mold growing, so I set the planter outside for a few hours in the sun.  Over the next day everything started to grow.  I did not water anything for the first few days - that initial watering soaks the dirt well enough, if you start spritzing too soon, you may overwater.  So once all 4 sections sprouted about an inch, I started spritzing every day.  We also had a few cloudy overcast and rainy days which kept me from setting the planter outside, so instead I put the overhead lights on in the kitchen.  I was amazed at how fast everything grew after that!  So don't overwater and give these babies some sunlight or lamplight and you will probably have the kind of success I had.  I'm waiting a couple of days for extra growth and for when I am home to monitor my cat's reaction.  I have been giving him sample cuttings and he seems to enjoy.  I may replant everything into a bigger bowl if my cat ends up pulling everything out of the planter.

I decided to try the pill pockets.  For the first month or so, they all loved them, and they made it easy to give the pills.  However, after three months:<br /><br />One cat still loves them.  I have to watch her carefully or she will steal the pills from the others.<br /><br />One cat has figured out how to eat around the pill.<br /><br />One cat sometimes takes them, but at other times just sniffs the pocket and skips it.<br /><br />I have figured out a few tricks that help:<br /><br />There are two types of pockets for cats:  chicken and salmon.  The chicken is slightly larger and more pliable and works better with larger pills.  However, I think that the cats find the salmon tastier.<br /><br />Get another cat treat and stick it to the side of the pill pocket.  Then place the pocket so the treat faces down.  My finicky cat is much more likely to eat the whole thing that way.<br /><br />The pill pocket still helps with the cat who eats around it.  After she eats the pill pocket, it is easier to shove the pill down her throat.  She is more likely to swallow it instead of spitting it out if it tastes of pill pocket.<br /><br />If you have two pills, try to fit them both in one pocket.  Giving the cat fewer pockets will make it seem more of a treat."

You know those spice jars you buy at the dollar store with the little clear plastic shaker top inside the black top? These spices don't have that clear plastic top inside, or a safety seal. When you receive these, they are literally just a glass jar of spices with no seal and a loose fitting black screw cap. I assume this is why the whole jar is wrapped in at least 3 feet of bubble wrap. Even so, as other reviews for this brand have noted, they leak. Any why wouldn't they? I consider myself lucky because only one of the 6 spices I ordered had leaked, and it was only slightly. This must have been because of the inordinate amount of bubble wrap - there was so much that I actually felt guilty for ordering so many jars and having wasted so much plastic.<br /><br />If they just put either a shaker cap or at least a vacuum safety seal they wouldn't need to use so much plastic (truly a ridiculous amount), and the other reviews of spilled spices wouldn't be a concern.<br /><br />On to the spices themselves...very fragrant but I have only used one so far, the herbs de provence. It was good, and for the price I would continue to buy it although I do think I like the Frontier organic spices better, even if it is just for the jar (with the shaker!).<br /><br />Summary - be wary of ordering until they add a seal or a cap inside, so there isn't so much plastic. I buy organic because I care about the health benefits, but I also care about the environment and lack of pesticides, and all this plastic negates even buying these."

It wasn't too sweet, and there was a little tartness to it...  my wife thought it was the carbonation, I thought it was a little lemon juice or something like that.<br /><br />The carbonation was pretty mild, so I didn't feel as bloated as I do when I drink a soft drink.  It had these little bubbles that were quite pleasant<br /><br />It has about the same number of calories as the equivalent orange juice, and a lot of vitamin C... but I'm not going to swap it for my morning OJ.  Neither my wife nor I are really big soft-drink fans, but if it's a choice between Sprite or Switch? The cost is similar, and this is definitely the lesser evil.  We think we might Switch!"

But then again, I don't know anything about sardines.<br /><br />La Sirena sardines (15 oz can) provides you with 7 servings:<br />protein: 12g, carbs: 2g, fat: 3g (approx.), and 250mg of sodium.  So the total is:<br />Protein 84g, carbs 14g, fat 21g, and sodium 1750mg. You'll find that the sodium and carbs are in the tomato sauce, so you just can eat the sardines if you cant have the sodium.<br /><br />Personally, I don't care about the high sodium content. In fact, if the world goes down the pipe I'll need anything I can get my hands on. For instance, I can mix the tomato sauce with olive oil and garlic to mix it with pasta. I know, I know, this is not gourmet eating, but when surving is the top priority you will eat what you must.<br /><br />Do I recommend it? Absolutely!!!<br /><br />BTW it's supposed to be hot...it is not"

The goat milk definitely cured her of the constipation, but each can I open seems to be different. Sometimes when I reconsitute it, I know right away that it is going to taste terrible because the smell is so strong. Other cans, I hardly notice it. She will not drink the bad-smelling milk, and when I have tried it, I have nearly vomitted! Majorly salty and gamey tasting.<br />Compared to fresh (Meyenberg from the fridge section of grocery store), well, it really doesn't compare. I have found the fresh to taste sweet, like cream, and then there is a little gamey after-taste, but nothing like the slap-you-in-the-face taste of the powdered. I was hoping to save money with the powdered, but since it is a 50/50 chance she won't drink certain cans, I am really wasting money. I am thinking I will have to stick with the fresh from now on.<br />If anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be, I would love to hear it!

They were sugar free, and, to me at least, tasted a little like Snickers (or at least how I remembered Snickers tasting; I hadn't had one in a while).<br /><br />Somewhere in there, Kraft changed the formula, adding sugar while still retaining some of the artificial sweeteners. I found the taste to be similar, but not nearly as good. Worst part was a metallic aftertaste.<br /><br />Well, Kraft stopped producing these, and I didn't miss them too much, because they weren't the same. I still checked periodically to see if they would come out again, though. I saw recently that they'd been rereleased, but also that they'd been reformulated yet again. Now they're chewy (they had been crunchy) and are sweetened without artificial sweeteners (they use stevia, a natural sweetener, in addition to more sugar). It has a stronger peanut taste than before, very different from the Kraft bars. At least that metallic taste is gone.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend buying a single box (or single bar if possible) if you want to try these. I used to prefer this flavor to the chocolate South Beach meal bars, but now I prefer the chocolate. The taste of those actually improved with the reformulation. I'd rate the original chocolate peanut butter meal bars 5 stars, the new chocolate meal bars 4 stars, and these new chocolate peanut butter meal bars 3 stars.<br /><br />What I'd really like is for someone to produce 1% cheese slices like Kraft produced under the South Beach name a while back.

The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck."

Whenever I can eliminate a step, I'm happy.<br /><br />This particular Melitta coffee, the Classique Supreme, has a rich flavor compared to the<br />rather ordinary coffees that I've gotten used to. Taken black, it has a smoky, vaguely<br />Espressoesque flavor that I find quite delicious. Adding a little creamer (I use the<br />liquid variety) cuts that flavor considerably. The package directions specify two level<br />teaspoons per six-ounce cup, which I find inadequate; twice that amount is much better.<br />Classique Supreme may be a bit pricey, and there may well be better ""gourmet"" coffees<br />out there, but it works for me, and I certainly would get it again in the future.<br /><br />My only complaint: the package is difficult to open without spilling some contents."

My first reaction was that this cat food must just be watered down, but after looking at the ingredients it didn't seem any more watery than other canned cat foods. And, more importantly, my cats just adored this food, much more so than any other canned cat food they've had (I like them to try different kinds).<br /><br />The cups or pouches of cat food have a non-metallic lid that peels back.

That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are ""100 Calorie Packs"", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

An extra 1.5 grams of fiber doesn't seem like a lot, but that's 12% DV instead of 6%.  For other nutrients, such differences matter a lot less.  The veggie version has 1 gram less fat, but that's only 11 calories worth of fat shaved from a food which is already fairly low in fat, and the total calories end up being the same anyway.  There are some 1% differences in some other vitamins, which doesn't matter.<br /><br />Getting back to the taste...<br />Even though there is only a small cauliflower influence on the taste, I found that it somehow did detract from enjoyment.  Blue-box Mac&Cheese has a very mild cheese flavor, which works OK when the noodles are normal.  But the very slight added cauliflower taste kind of masks the cheese.<br /><br />If you have kids demanding it 3 times per week, a little extra fiber and vitamin C might be a good idea.  But if this is your guilty pleasure food or just a backup plan for rare occasions, I would stick with the normal stuff.<br /><br />If you want to experiment with healthier noodles, there are several brands of dry pasta with omega 3 fats and added fiber.

I'll definitely say that Mango Peach Mio was better than other flavors I've tried though! It tasted like a glass of juice, and the flavor wasn't half bad. I don't understand how it can recommend only a few drops though- for one, it takes about 20x that amount to actually get any flavor in the drink! For another, one of my biggest issues with these Mio things is that I can't get it to do a ""drop"". You squeeze it until it shoots out as a jet. I haven't managed to get it to just do a ""drop"". The peach flavor is a bit strong in comparison to the mango, and definitely is that artificial candy-type peach, not real peach flavor. All in all, I found this flavor drinkable, although it still wasn't as good as just buying some juice. It was still more drinkable than the ""sweet tea"" flavor, which was absolutely disgusting!"

They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.

Scott,0,0,3,1326672000,"Not terrible, but I wouldn't buy again","MIO Liquid is a cool idea: Easily flavor any quantity of water, even on the go, exactly to your liking.<br /><br />But it falls short in several areas.<br /><br />*The taste isn't great, especially if you don't measure.  The opening on the bottle only squirts; it's not possible to count out drops.  This means that you may have a difficult time getting your drink just right if you use it on the go, which seems to be its biggest selling point.  The first time I made a glass of MIO, I put in too little at first, and the weak taste was off putting.  Then I added more, but that was apparently too much.  It tasted very artificial and chemically.  The next time I made it, I measured exactly half a teaspoon (2.5 ml, which is slightly more than the recommended 2ml) in 8 ounces of water, and I was surprised to find that I liked the taste a lot better.  It was good enough to finish my glass, but the chemical aftertaste is still there.  This isn't something I'd want on a regular basis.<br /><br />*Measuring it is dicey.  You have to squeeze kind of hard to get the liquid to squirt, so once it does, it's under pressure.  It splashed out of the spoon and all over the counter and floor (missing me, fortunately; I bet this stuff stains BIG TIME).<br /><br />*Used in the quantity MIO suggests, you can flavor 24 8-ounce cups of water.  Most people would usually be flavoring 16- or 20-ounce bottles, though, so you might only be able to flavor about 10 or so bottles.  There are much cheaper ways to have ""flavored water.""<br /><br />Overall, MIO isn't the worst product around, but I wouldn't buy it again."

I unpacked it and went to put them in my cupboard, and I discovered 8 dented cans. 8 out of 12! 5 of them were severely dented. The Amazon packaging was fine and it was in a larger box with other items which were not damaged, so it was packaged like that at the manufacturer. I was hoping the bad reviews from last year were fixed but I guess not. These cans were from Thailand (not Sri Lanka) so atleast they fixed that issue.

It advertises 'no sugar added' and '100% juice carbonated' and 'no preservatives', so I was expecting some sweet ~ this drink tastes like carbonated, watered-down orange juice, but it's actually a pretty good flavor, and packs 140 calories, 34g sugar and 36g carbs in a 'no sugar added'-'no corn syrup'- 'no preservatives'-'no artificial colors'-'gluten free' drink!

Now on to the product.<br /><br />I've been curious about 100% Blue Mountain estate coffees for years, and after much research, the Mavis Bank Estate came up as one of two that I wanted to try. I ordered the 1/2 pound bag; partially because this bean is so %^#* expensive, and also because I didn't want to get stuck with a pound of beans I might not like, and wish I had the fifty bucks back in my pocket. I much prefer Kona or a Costa Rican peaberry to this. It's a nice coffee; maybe too ""nice"". If you're a connoisseur of mild coffees, this is the one for you. It makes Gevalia Light Roast taste like French roast. Too delicate for my taste. I made a few pots, and kept increasing the amount of coffee.

More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is a lot of food packed into those tiny squares.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well."

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.  For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand.  Some other things I love about this brand:  it's organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That's a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup.

71135,B002PI82P0,A25O9GH8MSJO77,D. Frederick,4,4,4,1298764800,Saeco Vienna Plus A Worthy Successor To 8-Year-Old Vienna Deluxe,"I recently purchased a Saeco Vienna Plus to replace a Vienna Deluxe model that provided great service for eight years. We make about 24 shots of espresso a week, on average, so over the eight years the old machine pumped out about 10,000 shots. I felt we got our money's worth from that machine and was eager to replace it with another Vienna Deluxe.<br /><br />When I went to do my research, however, I found that Saeco had discontinued the Vienna Deluxe model. The Vienna Plus appears to be the only current model in the old Deluxe form factor. I initially was tempted to buy up into one of the pricier ""Giro"" machines, mostly for the more stylish design. But after talking to a couple of Odea and Talea Giro owners, and reading lots of online reviews, I decided these more expensive machines also might be a little more temperamental. So, I chose the Vienna Plus.<br /><br />It's only been about three weeks, but so far the Vienna Plus is meeting my expectations. The main difference between the old Vienna Deluxe and the new Vienna Plus is in the boiler. I assume the Deluxe model had two boilers, one for coffee and one for steam. (I think Saeco is now calling this feature ""Rapid Steam"".) I assume that because there was no wait time between steaming and brewing, or brewing and steaming. I always steam my milk first, and the Plus model makes me cool down the boiler from steaming temperature to brewing temperature before brewing the espresso. That's easy: you just disengage the ""steam"" button and open the steam control to run hot water through the wand. After less than a shot's worth of water comes out, the ""brew"" light comes on and you can brew your coffee. The wait time for this is under five seconds.<br /><br />Other than that small difference, I'm finding the Vienna Plus comparable to the Vienna Deluxe in terms of both the quality of the coffee it produces and convenience. Who knows how long the new machine will last, but if it comes anywhere near the eight years I got from the Vienna Deluxe I'll be delighted with the investment. Speaking of investment, while the list price on the Vienna Plus is similar to what I paid for the old Deluxe model, the street price on the Plus model is quite a lot lower. I was able to get the Vienna Plus from a local warehouse store for $380 including business delivery. California sales tax ran the total to about $416, but even so I paid about $200 less for the Vienna Plus than I paid for the Vienna Deluxe eight years ago."

The dog ate this food for about three weeks and every single time I put it out in a bowl, he would devour it right away.  He eats really fast and this food does not cause him to choke or spit the food back up - although now, three weeks later, I almost wish he had.<br /><br />In about two weeks time, I began to notice patches of fur gone in his coat and LOADS of shedding everywhere in my small apartment.  I was using the Furminator to shed him about twice a week and one time, I drew blood.  He was also scratching and licking himself raw.  Within three weeks, his collar had gotten too big for him - meaning, of course, rampant weight loss.  That was it: I brought him to the vet and they told me it was hard to tell because he's a rescue and their medical histories are difficult to conclude - so, it could either just be the change of weather from summer to fall or it could be his food or it could be that he is just stressed out from shifting environments and owners.  I switched his food anyways, because I was tired of the fur and felt sorry for him, even though he loved the taste of Canidae.  Within a week, the shedding stopped and he stopped scratching.<br /><br />I dug up some reviews online about Canidae and the opinions seem pretty mixed.  Either people's dogs love it and do incredibly well on it or it causes extreme negative reactions, anything from nausea and vomiting to allergies, which is ironic considering it is grain-free.  After all the digging, I personally conclude that it is because Canidae changes their formula periodically and their quality, although rated highly in terms of their ingredients, is inconsistent because of their processing methods: as in, nobody seems to be quite sure where they process their ingredients and when they do change their formula, whether this change affects that process.<br /><br />Its such a shame because it is a bang for your buck and my dog loved the taste of it.  I just wish Canidae would be more transparent about their process and maybe tell their consumers why there are such polarized reactions by dogs when they consume this food.  Overall, it was definitely a learning experience.  For me, the food rates at 2 (not a 1, because the price is great for the quality of ingredients) since my particular dog's reaction was negative."

The center chocolate fudge (which is soft enough to bite through easily, but not actually gooey) is quite tasty and the highlight of the cookie to me.  Chips Ahoy did a good job on that part.  The cakey portion of the cookies taste pretty good to me, too, but the texture isn't great.  They are kind of dry and just crumble apart.  So, not hard and crunchy, nor moist and soft.  More like dry and soft.  If you're like me, you're definitely going to want something to drink afterwards.<br /><br />I've tried the cookies at room temperature, warmed up in the microwave, and chilled in the refrigerator.  I like them chilled the best because the cookies didn't crumble apart in my mouth like they did otherwise.  Warmed up in the microwave, it wasn't much softer than room temperature...just harder to eat with some parts being uncomfortably hot.  Perhaps warmed in the oven would be better, but I haven't been inspired enough to heat up Chips Ahoy cookies in the oven, yet.  :)<br /><br />These things are bite sized and have 75 calories and 3.5g of fat each.  Not horrible for a cookie, for sure, but the taste isn't good enough to get me to pick these over something else.<br /><br />Given that the chocolate ""fudge"" is the main attraction to me, I liked the Megafudge version with the chocolate exterior better than the Chocofudge version because the chocolate flavor was much stronger.  Both are around 3.5 stars to me, but with the edge to Megafudge, I gave them a 4 and the Chocofudge a 3 here on Amazon.<br /><br />I'd definitely suggest getting a single bag at the local store to try these out before buying in bulk.  You might love these, but four bags is a whole lot of cookies if you don't.  ;)"

I used to think that, too, but then I actually faced the music.<br /><br />craisins are the same way, actually even worse.<br /><br />So while it's better than some chemical laden, corn syrup sweetened concoction from a gas station, these are a far cry from healthy.<br /><br />why can't i find unsweetened or lightly sweetened cherries at a decent price??"

It seems pretty fresh, even for ground coffee, and it's roasted the way I like it, which is medium-light.  The flavor (once you get some, more on that to follow) is mild.  It does have a weird aftertaste, which may be from the pods themselves or from the packaging.<br /><br />Mostly, though, this is a wasteful, expensive way to brew a cup of coffee, and it undoes all the good of using organic, fair trade beans.  It's a packaged coffee inside a package that's inside a package of packages.  This wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the amount of coffee inside the pod were enough to brew a decent cup, but it isn't.  One pod brewed as recommended doesn't hold your cream and tastes like what you'd get at your great-grandma's house in outstate Minnesota.  You can read the date on a penny at the bottom of your cup.  Brewed according to the directions, this is worse than no coffee at all.<br /><br />Two pods in ten ounces of near-boiling water for 4-5 minutes makes an okay mug of coffee, but you use twice as much packaging and spend twice as much money.  Two stars for the fair trade.  No stars for anything else."

You definitely get the chili nacho cheese flavor from it and in my opinion it's about the closest you're going to get to a ""real"" chip if you're looking for low carb. Haven't tried the other flavors though.<br /><br />Size: The bags are small, yes, but not that much smaller than a regular small sized bag of chips. You might find yourself eating more than one bag as a snack though.<br /><br />Price: Pretty good when you buy the bulk (12 pack) product although it works out to about a dollar a bag which IS a little pricey I guess but when you look at it as ""12 dollars for a pack of 12"" somehow, to me, it seems like a better deal. Also, if you like them, sign up for the regular deliveries and it shaves 2 dollars off each order AND includes free shipping so you really can't beat that.

193354,B000CS9ZY2,A37MH7ICH80QOX,"Kate McMurry ""Young Adult Author""",0,0,4,1343088000,"Handy, portion-controlled servings of cereal","Many motels offer these portion-controlled packages of Raisin Bran for their continental breakfasts, which is where I personally recently reacquainted myself with this cereal after having not eaten it in years. Compared to the high-fat, pastry-type muffins, white-flour bagels, waffles and English muffins on offer by the motel, this whole-grain cereal was a much better nutritional choice, even with its added sugar.<br /><br />I did a little research on Raisin Bran and learned that apparently not all Raisin Bran is made with the same ingredients. Some has high fructose corn syrup (HFCP) and some uses white and brown sugar. I checked the label on the individual packets on the Raisin Bran I ate today and yesterday. Neither packet said where the Raisin Bran inside was manufactured, whether the USA or Mexico, where Kellogg's has outsourced a lot of their production and whose version of Raisin Bran often does not have the authentic, time-honored ingredients that give Raisin Bran its unique flavor. But I am thinking that these small packets are made in the USA for two reasons. First, these packets had no HFCS, which the Mexican-made versions tend to have--the ingredients are: ""Whole grain wheat, raisins, wheat bran, sugar, brown sugar syrup, 2% or less of salt, malt flavors."" Second, these packets say, ""Distributed by Kellogg Sales Co. Battle Creek, MI,"" and no mention was made of this Raisin Bran being made outside the USA. I could be mistaken, but it has been my understanding if a product is made outside the USA it has to say so on the packaging.<br /><br />The quality of this particular batch of Raisin Bran was excellent. The flakes were crisp, the raisins in separate pieces rather than clumped together as well as not too hard, and the taste was exactly as I remembered it from all the many times I've eaten it in the past.<br /><br />For those interested in the calories count of this cereal, each packet is a single 35 gm. serving listed as 110 calories. For what it is worth, the main way I personally tend to judge if the calorie count given by the manufacturer is accurate is to assess it against the nutritional breakdown the manufacturer also gives of fat, carbs and protein. Carbs and protein are about 4 calories per gram (actually a little less), and fat is about 9 calories per gram (also slightly less--they are rounded to the nearest whole number for rough-and-ready calorie calculations). This portion-controlled serving is .5 gram fat, or 4.5 calories. It is 27 grams of carb or 108 calories, and 3 grams of protein, or 12 calories, for a total of approximately 124 calories. However--and I don't know if Kellogg's factored this in because many manufacturers do not--the body does not digest the 4 grams of fiber which are a portion of the carbs. If you minus the 16 calories for the fiber because of that, that leaves a net calorie count of 108, which is close to the 110 that the package label claims.<br /><br />This product is not suitable for those who are allergic to wheat, and it is not ideal for those who are diabetic because of the sugar it contains. If you are diabetic and want to eat a bran cereal, one option is to purchase a bran-flake cereal made without sugar and add your own raisins or other fruit. A great natural, no-calorie sweetener to use in that type of situation is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z9ASSK"">stevia powder</a>.<br /><br />If you are an environmentally and/or price-conscious consumer, I wouldn't recommend buying Raisin Bran in this format of small, individual serving packets for home consumption. It generates a great deal of non-recyclable trash, most of it non-biodegradable plastic, and it is a lot more expensive than buying the cereal in a large, recyclable, cardboard box."

It comes in a pretty little tin that I will use for other teas after I have finished this batch, however, it doesn't really have a great tea taste. It is there, but it isn't strong and it relies heavily on the jasmine to make the experience of drinking it enjoyable. The jasmine is potent, smells great, and indeed as a sweet taste during and after drinking, but it should be an additive to the tea, not the experience.  It was almost like I was drinking jasmine juice or something....unless you oversteep it. It still doesn't have a strong taste, but it is bitter as all hell. This is unusual for something that claims to be a an oolong tea (but would be typical of a green tea.)<br /><br />If you want a good jasmine tea at better price, get some of Numi's stock. Their Jasmine Pearls or Monkey King are both superior and almost half the cost."

I'm a pretty active person who is always interested in trying out these supplements (even though I know drinking plain old water works as well as anything else), and I love the taste of fruit drinks.<br /><br />This product certainly delivers when it comes to providing a fair amount of vitamins, especially C.  That makes it a good choice, I guess, for those who don't eat fruit but it may be somewhat superfluous if you're already a healthy eater.  There is taurine in this product too, but only 10mg which is a fraction of what you'd find in energy drinks.  It's a good way to get some vitamins, but I have not noticed any kind of energy boost from its use.<br /><br />I had two issues with this product, which I'll cover briefly:<br /><br />1) Taste - I have always liked the taste of fruit punch, and was disappointed with the flavor of this product.  It tasted vaguely of artificial fruit flavoring, but even with a generous amount I never found it very fruity.  It turned my water red, but no amount of the product could make the flavor appealing.  This is just my opinion, and perhaps for others the taste is just fine.  Related to the taste was the lingering aftertaste from the use of sucralose.  This hardly makes it unique among non-sugar drinks, but I thought it worth mentioning.<br /><br />2) Amount to use - The side of the container says, annoyingly, that one squeeze per 8 ounces of water is what should be used.  However, we don't all have the same squeeze so better directions would be useful (eg. two teaspoons).  Or even better, how about something that limits the amount coming out per squeeze?  It may not seem like a huge deal, but I found it frustrating.<br /><br />I doubt I'll use this product much, given that there isn't anything to really separate it from all of the similar products already on the market.  Others may find it useful, though, and I certainly wouldn't pan it as a bad drink additive."

I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.

The taste of the coffee itself is deep & rich. As such, the vanilla flavor is subtle. It's not as ""prominent"" as flavored coffee you buy in the supermarket (that coffee tastes ""heavy & fake"" in the flavoring department). If that's how you like your coffee(with heavy flavoring and less ""coffee"") you will NOT enjoy this coffee. This isn't the cheap Vietnamese coffee that everyone's been drinking since most companies have stopped using Columbian coffee. Vietnamese has a very lightweight flavor (no ""body"") and takes on a much stronger taste with artificial flavoring.<br /><br />This coffee doesn't taste quite as good when percolated through an electric machine. It's still great...but the flavor gets diminished this way. Try a French Press or better yet, a ""pour through"" gadget (see the manual coffee maker below) made by Melitta... instead. This way of making it makes a coffee that...well....blew my socks off.<br /><br />For coffee addicts & lovers...you'll understand this coffee. For those who think Yuban is great, probably NOT. Personally, I loved it and will be back for more. I would have given it 5 stars if the taste was the same with electric brewing as it was with more ""rustic"" methods using boiling water. As it is..making it by the cup made alot of difference and that's why my review gives it 4 stars instead of 5. Most people will use an electric coffee maker, and depending upon the brand (Krups would probably be ok) it may be less than superb.<br /><br />This is the ideal pot to use for this coffee:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Melitta-Manual-Coffeemaker-10-Cup/dp/B000MIT2OK/ref=pd_sim_k_3<br /><br />I use the one cup size for myself, and that's handy for me.<br /><br />*This coffee is ground very fine and is ideal to use with a manual coffee maker.*"

It's no better or worse than canned chicken.  It may be a little less salty.  The chunks of this are much smaller than they usually are in canned chicken.  This had that sort of tough texture of old chicken.<br /><br />I bought this mainly because it seemed logical to get a product claiming 7 oz. ""drain-free"", rather than a can with a lot of wasted water and less ounces of actual chicken.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise upon opening the first pouch and finding several tablespoons worth of water inside.  This certainly needs to be drained.  If I had unknowingly just dumped this ""no-drain"" product into a recipe I was preparing, it might have ruined the dish, due to the amount of water it contains.  So:  It does NOT contain 7 ounces of chicken.  It contains probably 4-5 ounces of chicken and a couple of ounces of water.  Since fish packaged this way, such as salmon, doesn't contain excess water, I see no legitimate explanation for this other than fudging on the amount of actual chicken in the package.  When I looked at the ingredients list, it even lists ""water""!  So on the front it claims ""no-drain"" but it lists water as an ingredient....<br /><br />The other thing that really irritated me was the ridiculous ""serving size"" claim.  Federal guidelines for meat like chicken list a serving size as 3 or 4 ounces.  This product claims it offers 3.5 servings.  Even if the package contained a full 7 ounces of chicken, that would still be a false claim; as it is, it's a ridiculous claim.<br /><br />What troubles me about these two issues is:  If the company has this kind of business ethic, how do I know that they bother with things such as, oh, like following sanitation laws?<br /><br />I would NOT purchase products from this company or manufacturer again.  We all have become jaded by the little cheats companies do, such as adding water to cans etc.; but two cheats of this nature, especially when you are featuring those aspects as a main selling point, is really unethical and concerning.<br /><br />Since the product itself isn't in any way superior to other canned chicken products anyway, and since you aren't really getting any more chicken here than you would elsewhere, there is no point even in selecting this over another product."

It was EXCELLENT back in 2007. I soon relied on this product for lunch (with Ritz crackers, Genova Tonno was very, very good) and also sometimes for snacks. I'd buy them in bulk here on Amazon at reasonable prices.<br /><br />Having worked with canned tuna, I can tell you the prices of the ""commodity"" have gone way up across the board for light tuna (e.g. skipjack) and white tuna (e.g. albacore). This is due to increased fishing cost and decreased supply of fish. As sad of an issue as overfishing due to the trawling methods, the reality is we're seeing this reflected in the cost and quality of various seafood products, most notably via the traditional 6oz cans being downsized to 5oz first by Starkist followed by other shelf stable seafood manufacturers.<br /><br />So this Genova Tonno product USED TO BE chunks of tuna in extra virgin olive oil with a nice balanced amount of salt. However, this product is now watery chunky tuna that has a bit of olive oil in it. And in case you didn't know, Genova is owned by Chicken of the Sea, who is actually owned by a Thai based company called Thai Union, which has its own packing facilities in Thailand. THIS IS NOT ITALIAN TUNA, do not let the name fool you. It is Italian-style, and like most of Chicken of the Sea products, Genova Tonno is packed in Thailand. Genova products are still very good and of a decent quality, but it just is not what it used to be because of the rising costs.<br /><br />Given the higher prices of this product, I no longer recommend this due to the $2+ per 3oz can price tag. This used to make for a relatively healthy, affordable and delicious lunch or snack, but it is now not a very good value. I recommend other alternatives (skip the pre-made canned tuna spread, it's got too much mayo and salt in it). Or consider making your own Tonno/olive oil tuna. Just try and look for ""natural"" tuna if you can since trusted brands' old fashioned canned tuna in water contains vegetable broth/hydrolized protein that is injected to allow the fish to soak up more water (industry's dirty little secret). There are plenty of fast and easy to prepare tuna/salmon options online if you look close hard enough on Amazon..."

My problem is with the marketing, which attempts to justify an inflated price with a dissertation of a long list of purported benefits. Problem is, most if not all of these benefits apply to all brands of sardines, not just these.<br /><br />One thing I'll say at the outset: If BPA free packaging is your most important purchase criterion read no further and buy these now. The packaging is indeed BPA free.<br /><br />But what about the whole concept of ""wild"" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.<br /><br />On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that all sardines are wild, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.<br /><br />Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about.<br /><br />For instance there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're ""sustainably caught along the California coast"". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are ""processed in Viet Nam"". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, ""These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations"".<br /><br />There are other issues as well.<br /><br />The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, ""Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk..."". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.<br /><br />We also learn that these ""delicious meaty portions"" are ""cleaned and scaled"". Buyer beware: this is quite different from ""skinless and boneless"". ""Cleaned"" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.<br /><br />How do they taste?<br /><br />Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring. These babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky, salty taste.<br /><br />But don't worry. It's not just any smoke, but ""aqueous natural smoke"" that they're treated with..."

I prefer to make my own baby food, but some times you need other options, especially when traveling. It is incredibly disappointing to find out that there is BPA in the lids. I just talked to the company and they confirmed this. My understanding of the canning process is that it requires heating the product to a high temperature in order to create an airtight seal. So not only is the food being exposed to the BPA during this heating process, but then during the entire storage process until an unknowing consumer like me buys it. I feel incredibly dumb for trusting Earth's best to be good for my baby. Get with the program and create BPA free lids!

Groh,1,2,2,1343520000,"Looks Nice, My Dog Likes it, Not Great Nutrition Though","I often wonder how much time is invested in making dog food look like something we feel better about giving to our pets. This food looks nice, different colors, 'meaty' looking moist chunks and my dog loves eating it.<br /><br />It's over $2 a pound so it should be great right?<br /><br />But, after reading up on the food at dog food advisor dot com I would never get this food again. It can be deceiving that beef is the first ingredient. But as it is explained in the review at dog food advisor, that is the weight of the beef before drying and processing - which contains a lot of water. So after processing, it is probably a much lower percentage of ingredient. Then there were other questionable ingredients including animal fat - the origin can be from a number of gross places, and a high corn meal content.<br /><br />So, I think much of the high price comes from the processing to make it look better to us and therefore make us feel better giving it to our dogs.<br /><br />I think I'm going back to my 4/5 star Kirkland dog food."

Despite the location of where the oats are grown, the taste is identical and the nutrition facts are virtually the same.<br /><br />McCann's oats are by far the most expensive. Even after Amazon's subscriber discount, Whole Foods store brand steel cut oats, for example, are several dollars cheaper (grown in America and organic). The only difference in nutrition data is that the Whole Foods brand is insignificantly higher in calories from fat as well as fiber, protein and iron. No doubt some of the price differential has merely to do with the tin can and transporting the oats across the Atlantic.<br /><br />So if you want to save several dollars, look at other brands of of steel cut oatmeal."

No, seriously, like someone had mixed a few tablespoons of sand in my peanut butter jar.  I immediately checked the expiration date thinking something had gone terribly wrong here.  The peanut butter was not due to expire for over a year, so age was not the culprit. I went online and googled the item, hoping to find some other reviews mentioning the gritty texture.  Sure enough, others had experienced the same thing, and apparently, according to an employee of the company, the maple flavor is SUPPOSED to be like that due to the cane sugar crystals.  In fact, he even states, that is his favorite feature of that flavor! WHAT?! Has the world gone crazy?! I couldn't even eat it...it was the culinary equivalent of running your fingernails down a chalkboard.  I have read that if you bake with it or mix it in something hot, like oatmeal, that the sugar crystals will dissolve, and you can actually enjoy the wonderful flavor, but I would not recommend using it at room temp or colder.  Other amazon reviews don't mention anything about the grit factor, so I guess it didn't bother them.  I can't conceive of that, but hey, more power to them.  I read that the cinnamon raisin swirl flavor has the same gritty texture, so keep that in mind if you are considering that one as well.

Whether by the cup or the pot, it brews VERY quickly (under two minutes suits my taste), with a rich tan color, with some orange brightness. When drinking, it exhibits no bitterness, even if steeped for more than twice that time - far beyond the point where Twinings and Taylors become bitter and wasted. I really only drink tea with 'milk,' (for tea I use almond milk unsweetened, not dairy, as I am vegan), but I tried this with fresh lemon and it was equally delicious. Fabulous taste indeed.

Unfortunately, the next day (including the 2nd bowl) I get this sharp pain running up and down inside my left chest.  I thought I was getting a pre-warning that a heart attack was on the way.  I would have to guess that there is something in the flavor packet which is to blame.  And what are those gray pieces of something floating on top of the soup?  Looks like reconstituted whale blubber.  I think I will ""regift"" these at Xmas time."

It inspired me to go to the local Indian grocer and purchase my own spices to make chai from scratch.  That was very successful (with help from the Internet and advice from an Indian friend).  I finally came back to try Stash's Chai again today and the first thing that hit me was the strong clove scent, which doesn't bother me as much after a few minutes.  I think the chai tastes a bit better this time around than when I first tried it.  Kinda grows on you, I guess.  However, it's not GREAT chai by any means.  It's okay for chai in a teabag.  Convenient.  But I'll stick to making it from scratch when I finally finish this box (waste not)."

Of course, the best are those you make yourself from scratch with love and lots of good rum. I gave Tortuga 3 stars because it seems to be a popular rum cake standard that consistently tastes good in comparison to similar commercial quality products within this group. Tortuga cakes are actually produced in Barbados with the company headquartered in the Cayman Islands and I imagine that this affects the steep cost of these cakes. Here is my critique of the pros and cons based on multiple purchases:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. A moist cake with a clear rum presence.<br />2. Same brand is available in many popular flavors.<br />3. Contains Tortuga 5 year old aged Gold rum.<br />4. One of the most popular choices for rum cakes.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. Tortuga uses many artificial colors and preservatives-e.g. Yellow 5 & 6, sodium propionate, artifical flavors, sodium alginate, polysorbate 60, propylene glycol and aluminum sulfate.  In my opinion, this compromises the taste and integrity of the product, making it less than ""natural"". The box reads...""A Taste of the Islands"" but it should read...""A Taste of the Lab!""<br /><br />2. The amount of true rum is negligible at best-less than 1/2 of 1%, which in a 1 lb. cake amounts to .0008 oz. Add your own rum more generously!<br /><br />3. To a discerning palate, these rum cakes taste as they are made-artificial-similar to the smell of a can of Play Dough when we were kids! A first glance at the cake tells you that the fluorescent yellow color does not exist in nature. Be sure to wear your sunglasses as you cut a slice or you will be blinded by the intense radioactive glow.<br /><br />4. Freshness/Expiration/Use By Date:  Another enigma! Look for the white square sticker on the side of the box. They use a Julian code to identify the date of manufacture of the cake.  For example, ""12233"" indicates that the cake was produced on the 233rd day of 2012 (August 20th, 2012). Better transparency for consumers would be helpful as would a clear ""Use By"" date. (Remember that it took decades for most US manufacturers to put easy to read expiration dates on their products.  The Islands are about 30 years behind us.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This is a 3.5 star product in my opinion. However, I have yet to discover a better tasting commercial rum cake. Make your own using a good recipe and great rum and pocket the savings.  Hope this helps."

Color is put on my roots every 3-4 weeks.  When I ordered this, I just hoped for the best regarding healthier hair.  The temps and humidity have been brutal this summer and I have seen some days since using this where my hair wasn't as frizzy.  Is that due to the shampoo and/or the conditioner?  Hard to determine.  Yesterday it was pretty frizzy again.<br /><br />Been using the product for about 2 weeks now.  Something I did notice a couple of days ago, was that there wasn't as much hair on the floor of the shower as I've been seeing for the past couple of years.  Wow, I wasn't expecting that.  It makes sense since this product is supposed to make your scalp healthier.  But slowing down hair loss is not listed as a selling point.<br /><br />The conditioner itself has a silky feel and a light pleasant scent and my hair feels good when getting out of the shower.  Both the shampoo and conditioner can be stood with the opening down, making it quicker to dispense.<br /><br />Two things I need to mention.  The first is that the item came well-wrapped in plastic, and it's a good thing it was.  There was some leakage with the shampoo during shipment.  Not a lot, but it would have messed up everything else in the box.  Probably better to purchase this from a brick and mortar store to avoid possible loss of product.<br /><br />The second is that in order to see a list of ingredients, you are told to pull up part of the label.  What???  Can you see doing this in a store?  Would you purchase one that already had part of the label pulled back?  I think a redesign is in order.<br /><br />On the whole I'm happy with using the product.<br /><br />Amending my review.  I've been using the product for over a month and I'm torn as to what I think of it.  I am definitely experiencing a lot less hair loss since using it, which is a HUGE plus.

I kept my mind open as I did not know what to expect, and the picture on the box looked appetizing.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor was barely OK, but the included broccoli package was a joke, I had to add frozen broccoli to make the whole thing decent.  I did not like the type of pasta used in this dish.  It was not the usual elbows that mac-and-cheese is most often made with.  Visually, the pasta reminded me the diamond shaped moth larvae casing.  Larger pasta would have made the texture less mushy.<br /><br />For chicken I used a day-old rotisserie chicken from Costco.  Legs have been eaten the day before, but the breast remained.  I skipped the browning step because the chicken was cooked already, added pasta, seasoning and water and proceeded per instructions.<br /><br />At some point I was instructed to add ""broccoli florets"".  The contents of the broccoli package were only identifiable as broccoli because that's what the package said it was.  ""Broccoli"" was very very dry, brown, flat, and most of it was just dust.  Thankfully, I had frozen broccoli that I added and it provided the color, the crunch, and the reasonable amount of the veggie component.  The cheese paste's flavor was good.  It melted quickly, and, once mixed in, it coated all ingredients well.<br /><br />The flavor of the final dish was OK, the texture was poor because of the small pasta used that lumped together.  In my opinion, my final dish's texture and the flavor were helped tremendously by the addition of the frozen broccoli.  Otherwise, I would not eat it.  As a side note, the dish did not reheat well in the microwave the next day.  It solidified in the fridge and reheating it in the microwave caused hot and cold spots and the cheese did not melt.<br /><br />Other than the seemingly low price, I am not sure what the appeal of this kit is.  You have to buy your own chicken, and, potentially, broccoli, so all you are getting as a ""bundle"" is pasta, seasoning, and cheese paste.  I think you can get the same quantities of these products for the same or lower price, plus you will be able to choose your own kind pasta, and will end up with a better tasting dish with a nicer texture."

Do not buy.<br /><br />THE WHOLE STORY:<br /><br />I was so excited when I saw these Rothchild Pretzel Dippers for sale. I was having a little get together with the swanky ladies down the block and I wanted to be certain that what I had to offer for our Book Club snack items were up to snuff. I ordered some Rothchild Red Pepper Dip <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045DO9QY"">Red Pepper Dip</a>and got out my Mother's antique China snack plates and was all set to go. I even had matching crystal pieces, one for the Pretzels and a smaller one for the Red Pepper Dip. As suits the snooty lady image, our book of the month was SOUL BY SOUL: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674005392"">Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market</a>.<br /><br />Now, I am neither particularly swanky, snooty, nor snobby. I had moved into a new neighborhood and wanted to make a decent impression on the nice ladies that invited me to join their book club. I wore my Blue Jeans, a top with some ""hip"" sequins and my blue sandals. That's it. It's me, just me, and I will try to give you some good food, be polite, and see if we can all have a good time.<br /><br />So, I had various snack type foods available, a bit of wine, some Iced Tea with Peaches, a little Perrier for looks and off we went. It is a good thing the other ladies were QUITE POLITE because the Pretzel Dippers were a flop. They looked and tasted pretty much like the square Snyder's Pretzels that can be purchased at the local cut rate grocery store: a. The square snaps:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7V3K8"">Snyder's of Hanover Pretzel Snaps, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> or b.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XOYSTE"">Snyder's of Hanover - Old Fashioned Dipping Stix Pretzels - 10-oz. Bag (Pack of 3)</a>. Actually, Snyder's dipping pretzels are the stick kind while Rothchild's resemble Snyder's little square ones with square holes in them.<br /><br />DRIPPERS INSTEAD OF DIPPERS: So, you can figure out right away, that Rothchild's Dipping Pretzels with holes allow all but the sturdiest of dip to drip or squish through the holes. My Snyders Red Pepper Dip had enough substance to it that the peppers DID stay on the pretzel, but the liquid that was associated with the Pepper Dip dripped right through. Good we had Mom's china to catch the drips. Paper plates would have inevitable become soggy. Thankfully, I had also made a Cream Cheese Based Dip and it DID stay on the Pretzels without any dripping. But, exactly what was the point? Making a sweet cream cheese dips that ends up being tried on Pretzels, instead of the intended bagel chips, was kind of a waste. So, I did not like these dippers because they would have been more appropriately labeled DRIPPERS.<br /><br />TASTE: The Rothchild taste was very Plain. Snyder's Pretzel taste, in my opinion, is much superior. I thought for the price that Rothschild might have thrown in a secret taste ingredient that made them worth the price. That was not so. Basically, they tasted like your usual prtzel with a little less salt.<br /><br />SOGGINESS: DID THEY STAND THE TEST OF TIME: I live in Arizona where the humidity is almost nil. Snyders Pretzels, The regular Rold Golds, and even those tubs of pretzels that the boss buys and sets out in the office hold up and stay fresh for 2 or 3 months with no problem. Not Rothschid Dippers. By day 5 after the party, these Rothchild Pretzels were starting to give, bend, and show signs of initial sogginess.<br /><br />MY SUGGESTION: Skip the Pricey Rothchild Pretzels. If it has to be Pretzels, you may as well go with the regular old Rold Golds. But, my real and truest suggestion, if dip is coming into play, Use Tostitos Scoops tortillia Chips. They are built for dipping and scooping and the nice ladies won't think you wasted your money on some high priced doo dad that is mostly for looks. Instead, they will think you are a smart, frugal little gal who fits right in with the crowd.  On the other hand, if you want it to look like you spent a bundle on a snack food with no redemptive taste, use as a dipper, or an item that makes it price worth the money, go ahead, buy the Rothchilds. I found them to be tasteless and a total waste of money. No recommendation from me!"

After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

It's ok - not great, not bad - but certainly not worth the premium over Nong Shim's Neogori or Kimchi Ramens.<br /><br />Taste:<br />no strong chicken taste, no strong spicy smell.  The ramen is spicy, but more like a jalepeno spicy instead of a kimchi ramen spicy.  The difference is in the...sharpness...if that makes any sense.  Other ramens have a low and nice hot burn, this one has a quick hot burn.<br /><br />Noodles are ok - nothing particularily special.<br /><br />Basically, I think people wanted a ramen where you don't smell too much after you eat it.  This delivers.  You can easily eat this, have a beer, and noone would probably notice - no dragon breath.  If that's what you're looking for, then this will fit the bill.  No exceptional taste, but nothing which will repulse people if you go to a public place later.<br /><br />Would I order this again?  Probably not.

These jars tend to last about 6 months then go bad ... or just taste really bad.  At first the taste is great,  but now ... it's hard to explain.  I thought maybe my popcorn was going bad.  Cooked up a batch with regular oil and the popcorn is fine so it's the Coconut oil.  Would recommend this if the whole container would be used up fairly quickly.  Makes many batches so unless you are eating popcorn every single day this container will turn on you.  Maybe if the product were sold in smaller containers.

But the sour effect was strong and some people might get some stomach discomfort.<br /><br />Again, the taste is sharp, sour and not very enjoyable to drink on a daily basis. It almost tasted like squeezing a lemon and drinking it on an empty stomach. I usually eat my lunch around 12:30 and it was around 3:00 pm in the afternoon when I tried this product. I wouldn't say it's terrible, but you feel you need to eat something after you drink it to take away the sourness.<br /><br />One thing that caught my attention was the warning on the package against using this product if you have high blood pressure.<br /><br />Final note: About 30 minutes after taking this product, I felt my blood pressure rose to a high level - the equivalent of 3 cups of coffee for me.<br /><br />Conclusion:  The sour effect during and hours afterwards and the risk of raising the blood pressure to a dangerous level with some people make me not recommend this products.

419994,B0000A0BS5,A238V1XTSK9NFE,Andrew Lynn,46,59,2,1064361600,Not actually for use in espresso machines,"Few things I'd like to point out:<p>1.  &quot;Espresso&quot; is not a roast.  It's a drink.  In northern Italy they make espresso from Vienna roast, in southern Italy they use French.  Starbucks appears to be using French roast, so they should just label it French roast like any normal person would.<p>2.  The product description says &quot;Taste Espresso Roast as both a shot of espresso and brewed in a coffee press. This is one versatile coffee!&quot;  This is patently absurd.  It's pre-ground coffee, and it's either for use in espresso machines or presses, but not both.  Here's why:<p>Making a shot of espresso requires a very fine grind.  Making coffee press coffee requires a very course grind.  If you have ground coffee that is appropriate for espresso machines, it will pass through the filter in a coffee press and you will have a cup of sludge.  If you use ground coffee that does not pass through a press's filter in an espresso machine, you do not get espresso.  You get cafe crema, which is a good, but entirely different, beverage.<p>Therefore, a &quot;Universal Grind&quot; is an impossibility.  They should tell you on the label what kind of coffee maker it's ground for, like normal people.<p>3.  It's over-roasted.  Starbucks has an excellent bean-sourcing operation that buys better coffee than any other company of its size.  Then they roast all their beans Vienna or French.  Most beans taste best at a particular level of roasting that varies with the bean, and for most beans that level is not Vienna or French.  So why roast all your beans too dark?  I guess it's just easier that way.  Also, it lets them rename Vienna Roast as &quot;Starbucks Roast&quot; because the Austrians don't seem to care.<p>That said, this is still better than what you get in the supermarket - Starbucks specializes in coffee and sources much better beans than any of the companies that also make cheese, hot dogs, shampoo or cigarettes.<p>Anyway, if you really want some good coffee, do this:<p>Buy a grinder.  Nothing makes coffee lose flavor like keeping it around after grinding.  If you have a drip coffee machine, get a grinder with spinning blades; if you have something else like a press or vacuum pot, get a grinder with burrs.  If you have an espresso machine, get a very nice grinder with burrs.  Amazon has good deals on all three kinds, just do a search for 'coffee grinder'.  It's not that much money, and if you're somebody who's willing to pay for Starbucks you should invest in one.<p>Find a local coffee shop that roasts their own coffee and gives you the date it's roasted on.  Freshness matters!  Good beans don't taste nearly as good after they've been sitting around.<p>Ask the people at your local shop to tell you about the correct amount of beans to use.  Most people don't use the right amount.  If you don't use enough, your coffee comes out bitter, especially if you have a drip machine.  Not enough coffee means the beans you do have get too much exposure to hot water, which makes bitter coffee."

My dog is a Cockapoo and although he is generally not a picky eater, he likes some treats more than others.  (So far the Science Diet treats and Milkbones have not been winners.)<br /><br />My first impression was that I really liked the ingredients list.  Unlike a lot of dog treats, I actually understood and recognized all the ingredients and the fact that the ingredients were all organic were a plus.  Of course, I knew none of this would make a difference if my dog didn't like them.<br /><br />So what was the result?  Most of the time he really likes these treats, though he still prefers more of the jerky-style and chewy treats.  (I know this because there have been a few occasions when he has turned these treats down for whatever reason but will still gladly accept one of the others.)  Most of the time though he seems very happy to have one of these.<br /><br />Worth noting, these treats seem a little large for my 20-lb sized dog.  They can easily be broken in half, but breaking them in half again from there can be tricky.  Unlike some other large-sized treats he doesn't have a difficult time eating these, but boy are they crumbly.  Because he has to take several bites to eat one crumbs usually go everywhere.  He's a thorough eater so generally I haven't had a problem with a mess being left behind BUT I don't know that I would want him eating these treats on carpet or another surface where crumbs could get trapped.<br /><br />Overall, they are a good treat.  I appreciate the ingredient list and the fact my dog likes them, but wish they were a little smaller so he could eat them without them crumbling everywhere."

Doug Bolden ""book addicted librarian""",9,9,4,1161388800,"Good, but mostly for Earl Grey fans","I am an Earl Grey fan, and I am currently enjoying a thermos of Stash's Double Bergamot as we speak. The citrus background of the standard Earl Grey mix is definitely amped up, making it into the central focus of the tea (as opposed to the black tea base). It is obvious you are still drinking tea, mind you, but now the bergamot flavoring is a lot more transparently citrus in origin.<br /><br />Cup by cup is probably the best way to make it your first time out. Making it by the traditional ""full pot"" method of ""1 per person and 1 per pot"" (and for me, often ""1 extra just for the fun of it"") makes the taste borderline spicy. This is how I first sampled it and it caused me to cough upon my initial swallow because I knew it was strong but was not quite expecting that level of strength. I recommend a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk to help bring the taste into roundness.<br /><br />Like Lapsang Souchong, this tea has a distinctive flavor that seems perfect for waking you up on a cold morning or refreshing you after a long day's hike. It gives me a little extra perk at work, and I like that.<br /><br />However, I cannot five star this tea because the flavor is a little too intense for the more casual drinker. I like having tea socially, and sharing it with my friends. Most of them outright dislike this one or only sip it sparingly (just like the aforementioned Lapsang Souchong).<br /><br />Earl Grey fans, however, can rest assured that it is a five star review for them."

Several of the items in the case have become household favorites and we've tracked down where to purchase them individually. My girlfriend is also giving one or two of these baskets to relatives for the holidays - that's how much she was impressed by this.<br /><br />So what comes in your gift basket?<br /><br />1) 7oz Bellentani Rustice Tuscan Style Salami. This is excellent. It's a very strong herb covered salami that tastes great and is sure to knock you for a loop the first time you taste it.<br /><br />2) 3.5oz Italian Herb cheese spread. Also excellent. It's great with crackers and compliments the salami wonderfully.<br /><br />3) 7.05oz Sandamiri Garlic Crostini crackers. These are amazing. The good news is you can purchase Sandamiri products on Amazon. The bad news is they don't have this flavor.<br /><br />4) 3.5oz Water Wheel wafer crackers. These were okay. Just your standard superthin wafer crackers.<br /><br />5) 5.29oz Spread Sticks. These long hard breadsticks are great with the cheese spread or mustards.<br /><br />6) .9oz Dolcetto Chocolate Pastry cookies. These are tasty and the chocolate is quite strong for such a little amount. Very happy with these.<br /><br />7) 2.4oz Crespo pitted green olives with herbs and garlic. These are TERRIBLE. I love olives and these things made me gag. My girlfriend had to spit hers out. These are nasty. I can not emphasize that enough. This is the one bad bit of the basket.<br /><br />8) .85 Caffe' Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee. I don't eat things with caffine in them (allergy) so I can't personally comment on these. High marks from those that ate them though.<br /><br />9) 1.3oz Amaretto Royale coffee. See 8) above.<br /><br />10) 1.2oz dark chocolate covered cherries. Who doesn't love these?<br /><br />11)  1 oz Hazelnut chocolates. Delicious. There are only two so they'll go fast.<br /><br />12) 1.6oz Honees. These are honey candies. I liked them but my girlfriend thought they tasted like very strong cough drops.<br /><br />Overall, you get a lot in the basket and aside from the olives (go with a can or fresh instead of these things), it's all quite delicious. I'd definitely recommend this to people who want to give a nice food basket to friends or family."

If the food coloring and preservatives dont stop you in your tracks look at how much quality meat goes into this....none.  I fed this to my 2 cats over a year.  The female got extremely fat and fur came out in clumps.  The male which was only 2 years old got sent to the animal hospital with urinary tract blockage.  The hospital bill was $1500 to save the cat.  Moral of the story... spend a little more for quality food like EVO or CORE and save way more by having healthy cats.  There is no doubt that this food and others like it is inappropriate to feed cats and will cause all sorts of maladies over time.

I have hated them all, for one reason or another. Most of the time it's because they're pre-sweetened with aspartame or saccharine or even straight-up sugar. I'm not really ""into"" too much sweet stuff. Because I have to consume untenably massive amounts on a regular basis, protein powder will need to be as unobtrusive as possible.<br /><br />I wanted to try Nutiva's hemp powder because it also had a lot of other nutrients in it besides protein, and because all of these nutrients and protein were naturally-occurring, not chemically combined to form some alien mud substance.<br /><br />Right away I noticed the difference. This stuff was powderized, but it's like powderized grass clippings -- olive-green in color, with a smell not unlike alfalfa hay.<br /><br />And this stuff isn't artificial. Besides 11g of protein for every quarter-cup of powder, it also has Omega3 fatty acids in it, and a few other goodies.<br /><br />I love the nutty flavor it lends to food. It changes the appearance of food, however, giving it a khaki-green cast, and it changes the texture of it a bit with a grittiness.<br /><br />It's great in smoothies. Not being a big sweets-consumer, however, I also try to mix the hemp powder into other foods. Mashed potatoes is an interesting choice, particularly if you don't mind consuming green mashed potatoes! It can also be stirred into sauces.<br /><br />I like it WAY better than any other protein powder I've ever tried."

Perhaps that led me to expect too much since I hadn't taken a bite yet, but I felt like this was just okay. I think the title ""chocolatey peanut butter"" is misleading; while peanut butter chips were on the bar, they were too few. I could barely taste the peanut butter, only noticing a hint. My husband, who loved peanut butter, was disappointed too.<br /><br />The description on the box of ""chewy"" is accurate, almost to a fault. The thickness of the bar - with rolled oats second on the ingredients list and rice not too much farther down - made chewing go on and on, without much flavor throughout. Most of the chocolate and peanut butter chips are on the outside; the chewing would have been fine if the flavor lasted all the way through the bar and not just on the exterior.<br /><br />All in all, they were fine.

In fact, I have eaten many varieties spanning all across the globe that have been met with looks of disgust and bewilderment from my peers. So given my extremely high fondness (and tolerance) for some pretty wacky varieties of instant noodles, it almost pains me to give this product a poor review.<br /><br />I wanted to like it. I really did. As a HUGE macaroni and cheese and ramen noodle aficionado, I figured there really could be nothing better than coalescing two of my favorite foods in the world into one convenient packaged hunk of noodles and cheese sauce.<br /><br />The first time I ate it, the powder in the packet did not mesh well with the noodles at all despite me following all the cooking directions and thoroughly stirring the flavor packet into the noodles. The ensuing cheese sauce was clumpy and poorly distributed, so I got this rich cheese flavor from about 1/2 the noodles and the other half just tasted like plain ramen. Also, I noticed that immediately after finishing the meal, my stomach got pretty angry at me and continued to remain angry for the next several hours. The flavor packet has potential, but it's just too overbearing and strong right now.<br /><br />I thought that this was all a fluke, so I decided to give the noodles another chance tonight. Nope. Exact same result.... once more the sauce did not distribute well amongst the noodles, and my stomach is cursing me for feeding me this monstrosity yet again.<br /><br />So sadly, Maruchan Yakisoba cheddar cheese and I are no longer friends. I've tried the Nissin version of this product, and it's much, much better. From now on, when I'm itching to get my cheddar cheese/ramen fix, I'll pick up that one instead."

I contacted the seller about this, and here is what I said, and how they responded:<br /><br />Me:<br />Hi.  I received 5 lbs. of Cacao nibs yesterday, but they are not raw like I ordered.  These distinctively smell and taste like roasted nibs.  After I noticed this, I looked at the bag.  The label says that it is Organic, but doesn't mention being raw (Organic, Herbal Essence Cacao Nibs).  Do you want to send me some raw nibs or give me a refund?<br />Thanks,<br />Dan<br /><br />Them:<br />Raw Nibs are so bitter if not roasted, All cacao nibs have to be roasted at low temperature.<br />All our customers love them, try it, if you chose not to use it, fine please return the 5 lbs bag for a refund.<br />thank you<br />imed<br /><br />So, they've decided that since raw nibs don't taste as good, they're going to roast them.  (Why not throw in some cream and sugar while you're at it?  They taste really good like that!).  It's fine if you want to roast them, just don't market them as raw!<br />But, I decided to give them the benifit of the doubt.  Maybe they ""roast"" their cacao at a low enough temperature to still be considered raw.  I emailed them back:<br /><br />Me:<br />At what temperature do you roast your cacao?<br /><br />Them:<br /> below 80 degrees.<br /><br />Below 80 degrees?  That's gotta be celsius right?  A quick conversion tells me they roast their supposedly raw cacao at 175 degrees.  That's not raw by any standard.<br />I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt one more time.  They did say that ""all cacao nibs have to be roasted...""  So I emailed Navitas Naturals about their raw cacao nibs (I was eating Navitas nibs before trying these).  Navitas processes their cacao below 118 degrees, making their cacao truly raw.  Halaleveryday is clearly a shady company who should not be trusted.  Yes, these nibs taste better than raw nibs, but you're not buying raw cacao for the taste.  I advise staying away from Halaleveryday, Alive and Aware, and Herbal Essence products.<br /><br />How are these roasted nibs?  They taste much more like chocolate than raw cacao does, and are much crispier and easier to chew.  There are definitely some hard pieces (pieces of shell, I assume?), so watch out for your teeth if you decide you can trust this company enough to eat their products."

I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love.

Personally, I very much like the flavor, although I do not think it is Timothy's best flavor.  That being said, I have found that time and again, Timothy's coffees are richer and better flavored than most of the brands that I have tried (and that is many).  I have this on auto delivery and will keep receiving it.  I normally drink this coffee in the afternoon and sometimes at night.  I prefer Columbian or expresso or any other stronger coffee in the mornings.  As for smell as other reviewers have stated,  I do not find it offensive.  I even brewed a cup, went outside, came back in and smelled the kitchen.  Nope, it did not bother me, and in fact, I thought the kitchen smelled good.  (I have an exceptional keen sense of smell.  My family can attest to that).  I believe that all flavored coffee is subjective and some coffee flavors appeal to the majority and some will not.  Thanks Timothy for great coffee!"

Quite honestly I was underwhelmed by their flavor.  They don't taste bad -- and there is a nice, subtle cherry flavor -- but overall it just tasted like a slightly sweet flour-based bar.<br /><br />When I eat a bar like this, I'm generally looking for a decent protein content.  Unfortunately these bars (like this brand's granola) get almost all of their calories from fat and carbohydrates.  Each bar has only 4 grams of protein.  If I'm going to eat a low protein snack, I want it to be something more delicious than this.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this bar, however, is the addition of chicory root to bring up the fiber content.  Each bar contains 6 grams of fiber -- nearly 25% of the recommended daily fiber intake.  This could be a great thing for people who ordinarily don't eat whole foods, but if your diet regularly contains whole wheat, brown rice, and fruits and vegetables that contain fiber, then getting 25% of your daily fiber in a bar like this is only going to cause intestinal discomfort."

But rather than being like ""clusters"" of granola it looks more like the Sweet Home brand of granola CEREAL we buy from the grocery store - except for those chocolate chunks.  But I tried it and it's pretty good, except there's so many little pieces and try as I might, it ended up getting all over my desk and lap.  The taste is fine but it's a bit messy, so I figured it must not be a snack.<br /><br />I took it home and tried it for breakfast.  It's not bad but I'm not used to eating cereal with chunks of chocolate (and I'm a big chocolate fan, dark chocolate, too - I even love chocolate chip bagels).  My 6 year old daughter, who loves granola cereal and almost always has it for breakfast, took one look at the chocolate chunks and declined.<br /><br />So I'm not quite sure what this product is: snack or cereal.  It's too messy for a snack but the chocolate is a bit much for cereal (to my taste anyway).  Calories are higher than the Sweet Home brand of cereal we usually buy (220 vs 200 for a half cup serving - the Sweet Home brand uses honey and almonds) but calories from fat were lower (50 compared to 60).

I was wrong. She chews on them until the flavoring on the outside is gone and then swallows them whole---regurgitating it until she is able to swallow it.  So now that I know that, I take them off of her when I start to hear it and throw them out.  I probably shouldn't give it to her at all but Im hoping that eventually she will just chew them completely.  I don't want to waste the whole bag, which is pretty expensive. But technically my dogs loves getting these.....<br /><br />On the other hand, I have an adult yellow lab that loves the large ones.  She is used to chewing raw hide and pig's ears so she just chews it right up with no problem."

This movie was one of the biggest surprises in 1988, it revolutionized the visual effects field, established Tim Burton as a director with a huge imagination, put Winona Ryder on the map, and helped Burton & Michael Keaton to be signed by Warner Bros. to film their strongest 1989 project: &quot;Batman&quot;.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a very funny ghosts tale with a lot of creativity and imagination, the characters are easy to love, the situations are funny and bizarre at the same time, all this translates into a very entertaining movie.<br /><br /> There are several memorable scenes in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, among them a possession scene at the tune of Harry Belafonte's &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, another is the one on which Adam & Barbara (Alec Baldwin & Geena Davis respectively) are taken to the underworld offices.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a good option to see the gorgeous Winona Ryder in one of her key roles, to see the creativity of Tim Burton at his best, and to see a very funny supernatural comedy."

I am ending those subscriptions and I'm not getting this stuff anymore. I recently received 4.5 pounds of Cool Citrus through the subscription program and didn't know that they changed the formula until I went on my ride and took my first few sips -- YUK!!! An excellent description another reviewer used to describe this stuff. The graphics on the packaging has changed with a small caption ""Now with Stevia"". I mixed 2 scoops with 24 ounces of water just like I used to except now this stuff with Stevia tastes like a rotten grapefruit. Maybe I'm mixing it too strong, but this is the amount stated on the label. I don't know the reason the old formula was abandoned. Did it contain potentially banned substances or dangerous ingredients? I hope not, but I know I can't stand the new formula. I would give the old formula 5 stars, but this stuff isn't worthy."

This particular Purina product is a little different from most in that it contains different colors and shapes of kibbles along with vegetables for a supposedly better- balanced diet.<br /><br />Beneful is an easy to find dog food sold in most stores, including both pet foods and grocery stores/supermarkets. Its widely available status and low price make it an easily recognizable and popular  product and its re-sealable bag is very convenient. It keeps the food inside and undesirable things out, so that the dog food remains fresh and edible for a long time.<br /><br />Name recognition, popularity, low price, nice packaging- these are all good extras, but what about the dog food itself? Well, it seems to be hit and miss with this product. The level of protein isn't too bad and the level of fat is kept under control, but the ingredient list is cause for concern. The first four ingredients are ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and whole wheat flour. These are not the ingredients you want to see at the top of a list for your dog's primary source of nutrition. Dogs need meat- not meat by products but real, quality meat- and the best quality dog foods have meat listed first.<br /><br />Some of the other ingredients are equally questionable. The dried peas and carrots are fine, but look at all of those artificial colors. Yes, it does make the food look pretty when poured into a bowl, but this is more for human appeal- a dog really doesn't care about seeing varied hues in its food. A dog just wants something that tastes good while you, the owner, want something with quality and good nutrition.<br /><br />Speaking of the taste, Beneful does score points in this area and that might be a good part of the reason why so many dog owners buy this for their canine friends. Dogs really love this food, and my dog is no exception. He will finish off a large bowl without even pausing and he seems anxious for more.<br /><br />So, how do I rate Beneful dog food overall? Well, I find it has both good points and bad points. It worst quality is the ingredients, but then again, when I look at the ingredients of other dog foods in the same price range, what I see on the Beneful label isn't all that bad. Dogs love the taste, and the nutritional aspects are okay. Thus, when all factors are considered, Beneful rates average overall. It can't compare to the high- quality dog food brands sold in many pet stores, but it has enough good points to recommend it-- barely."

The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is ""All-Natural with Vitamins,"" that there is only ""1 calorie in every 10 licks"" and that there are ""over 500 licks per bottle.""  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I've been using it about a week."

Hocking""",7,10,2,1308268800,It Sure Ain't Chocolate,"My wife and 15 year-old daughter don't drink coffee and are envious of my access to fresh coffee in my Keurig, one-cup-at a-time machine..  They do, however, love hot chocolate/hot cocoa.  The three of us were trying to decide which of many available boxes of Keurig compatible hot chocolate to order.  None seemed to have universally positive reviews, and most cost about a dollar per K-cup, which seems expensive for one home made mug.  We didn't want to make a mistake and buy 16, 32, or more, of a brand or type they didn't like.<br /><br />Voila!  Someone thoughtfully put nine varieties of hot chocolate in one box,  The ""Keurig K-Cups Chocolate Lovers Sampler Pack + Limited Edition Print."" Plus, it included thirty-five cups of hot chocolate, and for under a dollar a cup.<br /><br />The Chocolate Lovers Sampler Pack arrived yesterday.  Tonight, the three of us enthusiastically ripped into the box containing nine different versions of hot chocolate/hot cocoa.  We even moved the Keurig machine from the kitchen to the family room for easier access as we watched TV and simultaneously  engaged in a chocolate lovers orgy, an orgy which I agreed to join.  Following a directive from my daughter, I made a special run to buy marshmellows.<br /><br />If we each had three cups of different hot chocolate, and traded sips, we would each have tasted all nine permutations of the Chocolate Lover's Sampler Pack, and know which of the nine were our favorites.<br /><br />My first cup was, ah... dissappointing.  It tasted a little like coffee, not hot chocolate, but was so weak I couldn't be sure.  My wife and daughter, were soon, ""yucking"" with disgust.  They both hate coffee, and I joined them in my evaluation of this coffee.  We tried container after container, and the result was repeated, over and over.  The K-cups fell into one of two categories:  weak bad coffee; or weaker bad coffee.  I couldn't discern more nuance than that.  I tried making a cup setting the water quantity for a tea cup.  Nope.  Still too weak.  (And I have many Keurig coffee's that I love.  They often have the word ""bold"" in the title, and I apparently do like strong coffee.  I'm not saying everyone will dislike these particular K-cups, only that I sure did, and doubly so since we had ordered a Sampler Pack of hot chocolate and hot cocoa.<br /><br />Finally, my daughter found one Green Mountain Hot Chocolate, and it was pretty good, but watery.  She found another and after reducing the water quantity down to the tea cup size, with a couple of marshmellows tossed in, that one cup was good.  One cup of hot chocolate out of 35 cups.  Some chocolate lover's orgy. :-(<br /><br />I considered the possibility that perhaps I'm partially to blame.  Maybe the item description said that this was really weak, bad coffee, and not hot chocolate at all.<br /><br />But the Chocolate Lover's Sampler is the 11th hit in a search of the, ""Grocery and Gourmet Food,"" category using, ""Keurig hot chocolate,"" as the search phrase.  There are 24 items on this first page alone, and three additional pages of hits follow.  Hit number 21, for example, is, ""Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa Milk Chocolate, 12-Count K-Cups.""  The Chocolate Lover's Sampler is surrounded by Hot Chocolate.<br /><br />I've been buying items from Amazon since they were just a little stream, with some interesting rapids, not unlike the nearby Chatooga River which marks the Georgia/South Carolina border, and where the movie, ""Deliverance,"" was filmed.  In all that time I have never given an item one star.  I usually only write reviews if I have had a five star experience.  So I gave it two, although one (1) would have been fully justified.<br /><br />Now, how do I get my money back, or a credit on some real hot chocolate?<br /><br />UPDATE:  THREE DAYS LATER.  Yesterday I explained our experience on the official feedback form, and referenced this review for more detail.  I asked for a refund of 5/6s of the purchase price.  This morning, less than 24 hours after describing my experience, this amount had been credited to my credit card.  While it's debatable whether this product deserves a rating as low as two stars based on the fact it doesn't contain the product I thought I was getting - it could be perfect for someone who wants a variety of flavored coffees - IMO, one thing is not debatable:<br /><br />Amazon's customer service is five stars, plus, and I offer that evaluation based on over a hundred purchases, ranging from a $5 HDMI cable, to a $34,027 Volvo XC Station Wagon*, stickered at $40,650.  And, I was able to avoid almost $2,400 in sales tax.  But get this, the young man who delivered this beauty insisted on washing it in my driveway, and refused to accept even a modest tip.  I hope this doesn't get him fired, but he did accept a freshly brewed, delicious cup of Keurig coffee (I had one, too) made with the Parisian Extra-Bold Dark Magic K-cup.)*<br /><br />* Just kidding.

If you want to get their cans without BPA, look for a use-by date of around the summer of 2013.

It is a dense, heavy bread with a slight sour taste.  My favorite sandwich to make with this?  Liverwurst!  Just a little bit of mayo, mustard and a few hearty rounds from an 8oz chub - and I'm in heaven :).  I really love how neat and square these make my sandwiches - like something you might serve at tea.  You cut the bread in half to make sandwiches since the individual slices are rectangle in shape.<br /><br />I'd like to point out that the ingredients listed by this seller is incorrect.  There is no whole meal wheat flour in this bread.  The ingredients for Mestemacher Pumpernickel (at least according to the package that I currently have) is as follows:<br />Whole Kernel Rye, Water, Wholemeal Rye Flour, Salt, Oat Fiber, Malt Extract, Yeast.<br /><br />Mestemacher also makes a Westphalian version of this bread, aptly named Mestemacher Westphalian Pumpernickle (it comes in a black package).  Personally, I think the Westphalian version has a little more flavor and for those who were disappointed with this version, you may want to give the Westphalian version a try.  It is a separate recipe with different ingredients which are as follows:<br />Whole Kernel Rye, Water, Sugar Beet Syrup, Salt, Malt Extract, Yeast.<br /><br />The only thing I really don't like about these breads is the limited shelf life once opened (5 days, refrigerated).  Though...  it's nice knowing that it's preservative free and truth be told, I've never had a problem going through a loaf in under 5 days (there isn't THAT much bread in each of these packages).

I started her on this dog food about a week ago and at first she had bad gas which I thought was probably just because of the new food. Now she has terrible diarrhea. My boyfriend gave his dog some of the food a few days ago (before I had noticed my dog having diarrhea) to see if he might like it. Later, late that that night my boyfriend told me that the food must have not agreed with his dogs stomach because he got diarrhea in the house. Hmmm. Sounds like this food is not what it seems.

We tried Enfamil Gentlease, and he seemed to hate it right from the start, then after remembering my cousin rave about this formula with her daughter, we tried the Good start.  I wish I had started him off with this from the beginning.  He immediately drank it down, unlike the Gentlease which he wouldn't even take more then a few sucks of.  He tolerated it so well, and the constipation was gone.  He was still gassy a bit, as all babies seem to be, but nothing excessive like before.  For a few weeks he was still a bit fussy when having a bowel movement, but again, it was such a drastic improvement from where we had been prior.  As time went by his stools became easier to pass, and now there is no fussing at all.  The preparation is easy.  You simply add the powder to water and shake.  There had been different directions on some older cans with boiling water then adding the powder, but that has since been replaced with the simple, add powder to water and shke version.  THere are far fewer bubbles after shaking then the other formula's I have tried (Similac, Enfamil) and the clumping is minimal.  Simply take a spoon etc.. to break up clumps.  The smell is tolerable too, and is much better then the other formula's I have smelled.  The price is good as well.  Babies r us seems to have the cheapest price at around $20 a can, but other stores like Kmart, Target etc... seem to come in around $23 a can and drug stores (not recommended) come in highest at $25-26 a can.

The flavor really increased when I decided to use milk in place of water.  Wow.....it made a big difference in the flavor and the richness!  I highly recommend skipping the water and going with warm milk.  Here is what I did...I heated some whole milk in a saucepan over low heat until the milk was lukewarm. I then added the Peppermint Mocha Latte mix. (Waiting until the milk is WARM helps the powder to dissolve and creates a smoother drink.) I then continued to heat this mixture until it was hot - about the temperature of hot coffee or cocoa.  Yum!<br /><br />If you are expecting a coffee tasting drink (as the Latte in the name implies) then you will be disappointed.  I would describe this more as a hot chocolate or cocoa type beverage.  The taste was really nice and the minty flavor was refreshing. There was a good balance of mocha and peppermint which resulted in a smooth, rich flavor."

Most people are preconditioned about orange flavor. It is supposed to taste a certain way, but black cherry has more freedom to be individual.<br /><br />I discovered a wonderful way to use Switch black cherry -  cooking salmon!  I mixed the Switch black cherry  in the blender with a half cup brown sugar and a tablespoon of honey.  To that I added a shake of Chinese five spice, a shake of  ground cloves, and approximately 1 teaspoon of dry mustard.  I mixed that in the blender.  I sprayed a baking pan with butter flavored cooking spray.  Then I placed boneless salmon  - about one fourth fish - in the middle of the pan and surrounded it with slices of peeled pre-baked sweet potatoes.  The liquid from the blender went on top of  all of it.  Into a hot oven (450 degrees) went the pan.  As soon as the liquid bubbled, I carefully turned the salmon over, basted it with the glaze, and let it cook five minutes.  While it was still in the pan, I cut it into two servings, topped it with pecan pieces and returned it to the hot oven  another two minutes to heat the pecans.  It was pretty on the plate!  I poured some of the glaze over it.

The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).

Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is ""All-Natural with Vitamins,"" that there is only ""1 calorie in every 10 licks"" and that there are ""over 500 licks per bottle.""  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I've been using it about a week."

Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet."

Because its tofu it takes on the flavor of whatever you cook it with, which in my case was spaghetti sauce. Overall I thought it was a pretty good product.

Secondly, the coffee comes in very convenient single serve packs, which make brewing coffee very simple and fast in the morning.

He enjoyed the meal and stated that he'd love to have them on hand if the price point was more reasonable.  He ate his  Fusilla & Veg Marinara with a large salad seasoned only with some balsamic vingar and had it for his dinner meal.  To use the Chinese food cliche, he told me an hour later he was hungry again so I made him a grilled chicken breast.  That got me to thinking that the packaged meal alone wouldn't work for us as a stand-alone  meal.  We'd have to add to it for it to work.  If these were a dollar per package cheaper after Subscribe & Save, they might make a good shelf stable meal to which you could add cooked chicken strips, canned chicken, black beans or even a high quality pouched tuna.  On it's own, it's not filling enough nor nutritionally complete.<br /><br />Right at this moment, Amazon is showing me an offer for a $5 off Amazon coupon which when applied, brings the price point after Subscribe & Save down to $2.38, which is  quite a bit better and rather tempting.  However, after seeing this, I asked my husband if he wanted me to order some for the pantry and suddenly he wasn't as in love with the product any more.  Oh well!  When you add in the cost of a small salad plus some lean protein such as the gilled chicken breast, even with the $5 off, it brings the per meal cost back up to around $4.60.  That may sound like a bargain if you eat out often or grab fast food a few nights a week but we don't.  I plan our meals out for the week and even sometimes for an entire month ahead of time to get the most from every grocery item we buy and I could make this same dish using Barilla High protein pasta, my own vegetable marinara with veg from my gardens and come out quite a bit cheaper.  I also think I could eliminate some of the high sodium contant and bring down the fat in the dish as well.<br /><br />I gave it four stars, however, because hubby liked it, it was simple to prepare and even a starving teenager can toss in some chicken strips of canned chicken to make it a more filling meal.  There's enough sauce in the meal to coat a moderate amount of added chicken or meat.  I could see this being a good pantry staple for a college student or a busy single person. As shelf-stable meals go, even though I wasn't all that impressed with the sodium count and fat, this brand compares quite favorable with other shelf-stable meals. It could be a good choice for folks in ned of something o brag and nuke quickly at the end of a long day and in place of ordering in restaurant food.  For a family on a budget.. not so much of a deal."

I wrote to Sun Maid, hoping I had purchased defective bags, the response was<br />""Thank you for your inquiry regarding your package of Sun-Maid Tropical Trio.  We have changed this product due to the fact that the larger pieces have more flavor and they do not 'sugar' as quickly as the smaller pieces.""<br />I am not sure what they mean by ""sugar"" but I always found the small pieces to be quite flavorful. I have tried cutting them up on my own, but the results were not good, too sticky on the inside to cut well.<br />I am switching to Welch's Tropical Sensation, since they are the only other brand I have found with the smaller cuts of fruit.

FungusAmongus sent me an email and asked that I speak with their truffle expert (name withheld).  The expert proceeded to tell me that the product was actually a ""summer"" truffle and that summer truffles don't have a smell or taste.  I know this is absolutely UNTRUE as I have used both summer and winter truffles and both have very distinct and pronounced tastes and aromas (though black winter truffles are ""louder"").  At any rate, the expert said he would authorize a refund and that I just needed to work out that part with FungusAmongus.  So I left several voice mails, email messages, and even tried to contact them through their own contact webform.  NO RESPONSE.<br /><br />Part 2:  I contacted Amazon's customer service and within 5 minutes they generated a full refund.

I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice.

The carbonation is very light, though it doesn't make The Switch taste much lighter than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GPXRQS"">Juicy Juice</a>. Overall, it tastes pretty decent, though not much like you'd expect it to when you take the energy drink type of packaging in to consideration.<br /><br />Reading the label is a bit disheartening. True, it's 100% juice, but it's from concentrate. There's no added sugar or corn syrup -- but the 8.3 ounce can packs 130 calories. In fact, compared to a 12 ounce can of Coke, the Nutrition Facts label tells a surprising tale:<br />Calories: The Switch - 130 / Coke - 140<br />Sodium: The Switch - 15mg (1%) / Coke - 50mg (2%)<br />Carbohydrates: The Switch - 35g (12%) / Coke - 39g (13%)<br />Sugar: The Switch - 33g / Coke - 39g<br /><br />Kind of surprising, when you consider that the values for Coke are for 50% more product. So I'm not really clear on how The Switch is promoting itself as substantially better than any soft drink on the market. Sure, you're getting 100% of your RDA of Vitamin C, but anymore, getting that much Vitamin C is easy to do without even trying.<br /><br />The product isn't bad, it just isn't very practical. You could buy a bottle of Juicy Juice (or any of the 100% juice options from store brands at most retailers), mix it with a little club soda, and have basically the same product for 1/4 of the price. If you side towards the more environmentally conscious mindset (and makers of The Switch seem to think that their customers do, based on the labeling), that's an all around better alternative to a pack of 24 small cans."

The taste was alright; nothing particularly special, probably a solid three stars. I felt it was a little heavy on the dried plums (that's what we call prunes now, thanks to the boys in marketing for that one), but otherwise it was a respectable mix of fruit. My problems with this product began when I looked more closely at the ingredients.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients, directly from the package:<br /><br />California Pitted Dried Plums, Dried Mediterranean Apricots (Product of Turkey), Dried California Peaches, Dried Pears (Product of USA or Argentina), Dried Apricots (Product of USA or Argentina), Dried Apples (Products of Chile, China or Argentina), Medium Chain Triglycerides (from coconut and/or palm kernel)* and Natural Flavoring. Sulfur Dioxide and/or Sodium Bisulfate and/or Potassium Sorbate added as preservatives.<br /><br />* Adds a trivial amount of fat.<br /><br />I have two main issues with this:<br /><br />1. The apples are not from the United States. To be clear, I don't have a problem with imported fruit; it offers consumers year-round availability of things that otherwise might only be available for a couple months. But why are we importing apples into the U.S.? Don't we grow, like, a bazillion of these things every year? And from China no less? If I visited China, it would be risky for me to eat the fruit... is it somehow okay when it's dried out and sold here?<br /><br />2. There's fat added to fruit. Sure, it's a ""trivial"" amount, but why is this even happening at all? It's fruit, it doesn't need fat added to it, especially in triglyceride form.<br /><br />Now, neither of these issues are the end of the world... but I feel like I can do better. I noticed the availability of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAUKP4"">Mariani Mixed Fruit</a>, made by the same company, but without Chinese apples or triglycerides listed among the ingredients. Do they have two lines of the same product? I'll probably just stick with getting my dried fruit at Trader Joe's... their stuff is pretty reliable."

I have tried making various marshmallow cookies because I like marshmallows but none of my recipes ever turned out well. They were either too messy and gooey or the marshmallow stiffened up. Mallomars Pure Chocolate Cookies have none of the problems my poor baking attempts have suffered.<br /><br />Mallomars Pure Chocolate Cookies consist of a thin round cookie with marshmallow on top all covered in a dark chocolate shell. I was somewhat hesitant to take a bite considering my past recipe disasters but this is actually a surprising good cookie. The round cookie on the bottom is thin and crunchy. Other reviewers have said it is a graham cookie but it seemed a bit sweeter than that to me. The marshmallow is soft but not gooey and is enough for a good taste but not so much as to be overpowering. The chocolate covering is hard but not tough and leaves a nice aftertaste in your mouth. The cookie crumbled a bit as I bit in but did not fall to pieces. My Mallomars arrived in an 8 ounce box in a padded envelope and arrived in good shape. Three cookies had parts of their bottoms broken off but otherwise they were in good shape and were not squashed and the chocolate was not cracked.<br /><br />Overall, Mallomars Pure Chocolate Cookies are a surprising good cookie. I think I can now give up on trying to bake a marshmallow cookie. In fact, I may try to sneak these onto my Christmas trays of homemade cookies at our Christmas Eve get-together."

They even have a lentil festival every August, no kidding. When I saw these lentils on Amazon I had to try them - I belong to Amazon Prime, get free two-day shipping - and they are excellent. Like others say, they are small, firm, and really flavorful. They take more time and water to cook than most other kinds of lentils I've used due to their firmness, but retain their shape really well.  They are also chewy, not mushy, and the flavor is kind of nutty. You can do anything you want with them - make curry, soup, salad, mix them with rice or quinoa or chopped veggies, season them any way you like. I love lentils in general, other faves are red lentils (sweet and mushy, make great soup) and black lentils (tiny and round, and a great alternative to black beans) which I can get at local health food stores, but these are truly top shelf, and I've never seen them in stores. I agree with what someone else said, too, they are very clean, I haven't found any rocks or twigs in them. Just great lentils.

The box is wonderfully designed with multi-colored, foil embossed design (it would probably make a great gift for your favorite Bob Marley fan), but the amount of packaging is unbelievably excessive for, maybe, six or seven ounces of coffee.  The elaborate declarations of ""fair trade,"" ""ethical treatment of farm workers,"" ""biodiversity"" and ""sustainable cultivation"" (among other first world catchphrases) ring hollow for me.  This all may be true but it's hard not to be cynical and slightly suspicious of the true motivations for the lofty rhetoric on the box.<br /><br />The company's declaration of ""we believe that pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial,"" sounds absurd when compared to the amount of waste in the packaging of their product.

It's still in solid form due to the cold weather in my area, but I've just been taking small chunks of it and allowing it to melt in my hands for a few seconds or so before applying to skin.  As others users have noted, I've found this oil to have a toasty-like smell which I don't mind so much.  I might try the Nutiva brand next time because I've heard it has a nicer smell.  In the near future I'll probably purchase more coconut oils just for cooking/baking purposes.  I give this brand an A."

But that all ended when I started putting the k-cups in it.  The measurements are off.  Any k-cup with a slightly rounded top will catch when you try to open or close the drawer.  There is not enough clearance.  Also, the drawer is not long enough to hold 7 per each of the 5 rows like advertised.  Again, the measurement if off slightly so it will only hold 6 (for a total of 30) with a little room left over so they do not fit snug.  Which leads to the 3rd problem:  with 2 rails instead of a solid bottom or mesh to sit on, the k-cups tilt so, again, with the poor clearance, they get hung up when you try to open or close the drawer.  Regretfully, this is not as advertised and not measured property to use for k-cups.  I am really not hard to please, but this is way wrong at any price."

I bbq using a weber smokey mountain often.  I usually make my own rubs.  I thought this might be a good product to keep on hand in case I didn't feel like making a rub.<br /><br />Most good bbq rubs have a base of salt and brown sugar.  This rub does not contain any sugar.  It is however very heavy on the salt.  I am used to using a large amount of rub when bbq to get a nice bark.  I made some ribs using this rub and they were so salty they were almost inedible.  I tasted the rub before hand and cut it with some brown sugar but clearly not enough.<br /><br />I have used this rub on other foods and had better results.  A little is very delicious on french fries or corn on the cob where I use this in place of salt.<br /><br />If you intend on using this rub heavily for low and slow cooking plan on cutting it heavily with brown sugar.  I prefer a salty spicy rub over an overly sweet rub but this is too much on its own.  I just wish they used more of the other ingrediantes and less salt as the spice is very tasty.<br /><br />If you plan on using this to spice up other foods in place of salt you may be very happy with this.

I am changing my rating on all of these products from 5 stars to 3 stars.  With the switch to ""Lunch Express,"" apparently they decided to lower their production costs and make more on each unit.  First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.  The convenience, taste and portioning are still attractive, so I'm continuing my subscription for now -- which is probably what Healthy Choice is counting on -- but just wanted to state my disappointment over yet another company placing greed over customer satisfaction."

Packaging could use some work though,"I am a tea fanatic, 4-6 cups a days of all sorts of loose leafed teas from local tea shops around town, and grabbed these at a local grocery store last week to try out.  I am also a fan of honey, all sorts, although I prefer local/organic raw honeys over the mass-produced cheap kind.  I will be travelling for Christmas this year and portable honey sounded great!  First impression was that a box of only 20 was a tad expensive - you can buy a bottle of very quality honey for the same price, but the bottle would last you much much longer.  However, I still bought it and tried it out, and here are my impressions:<br /><br />CONS:<br />-  Some of the drops had oozed/leaked and the inside of the box was a tad sticky.  Also, some of the drops were sticky.  Not impressed with the packaging job.<br />-  When popping open 1 serving of the honey, it wasn't solid like a hard candy would be, it was a tad gooey, and I had to dig it out with a spoon to get it into the hot water because it was stuck to its container.  It didn't just pop right out.  It says on the box that you can hold this honey in your hand... no you can't and I wouldn't recommend it!  haha<br />-  As previously mentioned, a tad pricey for only 20 servings<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Perfect portion size for 1 cup of tea if you like your tea just mildly sweetened.  You will need 2+ drops if you like it very sweet<br />- Flavor is very good and you can taste the lemon.  It seems like a good quality honey was used.<br />- Great for travelling IF you put the drops into a Ziploc bag or other leakproof container, as some of them were sticky, so something must have leaked somewhere in the box.  It's a ""peel off the foil and pop out"" sort of container for each drop, so if you throw these loose into your purse and something pierces the thin foil, you're in trouble!<br />-  Directions for use were spot-on.  It says to drop the honey in hot water and stir for 30-60 seconds.  I was stirring for almost 60 seconds!  It's such a solid piece that it takes some working to get it all to dissolve, and of course the hotter the water, the better.<br /><br />This was an impulse buy and I will probably only save the use of this honey for when I am travelling since it was so expensive per serving. The honey tasted very good and seemed of good quality but the packaging had some issues.  I haven't tried them as throat drops, but it sounds like a great idea!  I will probably stick to my raw honey in the jar or bottle for everyday use though... these are just a novelty for now!"

Matt is a food addict, and I have to control his intake, giving him four measured meals a day.  Only one of those meals per day is a half of a 3 ounce can of Fancy Feast or a worthwhile substitute.  The caloric intake is such that giving him any more than that would double his already 17 pound size.<br /><br />In any case, I compared the Guarantee Analysis of Fancy Feast to Petite Cuisine, and here are the numbers:<br /><br />1.  Crude protein:  Fancy Feast...minimum 14.0%; Petite Cuisine...13%.<br />2.  Crude fat:  Fancy Feast...minimum 3.0%; Petite Cuisine...1.5%.<br />3.

I really like the diet cranberry, diet grapefruit and the diet root beer is literally the best soda I've ever had - diet or non-diet. Some others I didn't like so much. The cola didn't really do it for me, and I'm on the fence over the ginger ale. There is a bit of an after taste on the sodas, but they do have a lower calorie count (even the non-diets) than regular sodas.

Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.

They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces.

My family and I enjoy most Taco Bell products; both from the restaurant and the in-store products.  I love their Fire Sauce, and wish they sold it in bottle form at the grocery store.  So when I saw this new Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce, I was excited to try it.  I really enjoy just about anything spicy, so my hopes and expectations were high.  Now that I have tried this sauce, I am somewhat disappointed yet find it to be a good addition to most Mexican foods that I enjoy.<br /><br />The name of the product clearly states ""Bold & Creamy.""  I agree with the creamy aspect of their claim, but feel that the word bold should be changed to something less aggressive, like tangy.  You definitely detect notes of Jalapeno peppers in the sauce, but it is quite subdued and has a somewhat artificial taste.  But I'm not bashing the product or saying that it isn't tasty.  I have found my favorite use of this product is with tacos and burritos.  I add a light amount of the Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce to my soft and hard shell tacos, and then add generous amounts of Taco Bell Fire Sauce (I hoard packets of that stuff and always try to get as much of it as I can whenever I visit the Taco Bell drive-thru).  The Jalapeno sauce gives the tacos a bit of a sour cream flavor, while also added just a slight bit of Jalapeno kick.  I have tried this sauce with several other things from sandwiches to salads, and even a spicy chicken wrap.  While I didn't mind the sauce with the wrap, I didn't enjoy it at all with sandwiches and salads.<br /><br />Overall I will likely continue to purchase this product going forward, but I think a single bottle will last quite some time.  It doesn't have a good enough taste to stand on its own, as a dip or as a replacement for other sauces that I enjoy.  I don't find it to be nearly spicy enough, but I also understand that making it much more spicy would likely limit their sales to a more specific consumer market.  It is an above average product that is a solid compliment to some Mexican dishes, but I don't see this becoming a best seller among the Taco Bell brand name.  But I don't think the product is the type that most people will either love or hate.  It falls right in the middle, and I think most people will find it to be moderately satisfactory.  Go ahead and give it a try for yourself.  I suggest picking up a single bottle before buying a lot of 6, as they sell on this site, just to make sure you enjoy it enough to consider stocking up with that quantity.  I hope you enjoy it.  =o)"

Olfactory memories from large-scale grass cutting arose.  Even with the rich dark chocolate, I can't consume this protein straight or even mixed with milk.  The pungent taste needs to be blunted with large amounts of cinnamon and Splenda and/or mixing with high protein cereals such as Kashi or Special K.<br /><br />Another undesirable aspect of this protein includes the large amount of carbohydrates:  2.1 grams for every gram of protein. The economics are underwhelming as well.  It costs about 10.8 cents per gram of protein versus 2.7 cents per gram for the Nutribiotic Rice protein or 2.2 cents per gram of protein for the Cytosport offering at Costco.<br /><br />Cons<br />Terrible taste<br />High carb content<br />Poor economics<br /><br /> Pros<br />Rich dark chocolate flavoring"

Perhaps that was a bad idea. Chewing the gum, I have found the flavor to be a bit inconsistent from piece to piece. Some will taste pretty good with barely a hint of mint, others will full on assault my taste buds with a horrific menthol sneak attack. The licorice flavor itself isn't very strong and doesn't last very long. It's pretty much through after about 10-20 minutes, leaving only the atrocious menthol flavor. If you can't tell, I'm not a fan of menthol. I know the name Extreme Ice should have given it away, but can't help being rather disappointed by the whole thing."

I don't add any oil as someone suggested here (that makes sauces not stick so well later), just make sure the water is fully boiling and then stir periodically while it comes back up to a boil and it won't stick together at all. Make sure you salt the water, not just for flavor but because it raises the boiling temperature of the water. Don't overcook and if you're going to toss it into a skillet with veggies, undercook just slightly. It's pretty easy to make the adjustment, and it's good to keep in mind that this is a different kind of pasta so it does cook differently - that isn't a flaw.

It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."

There is a definite difference between the Penzey's ginger and the Ginger People's Baker's Cut; the Penzeys is noticeably sweeter, and the Baker's Cut has more heat. The ingredients on the Penzeys product is shown as ""Cane sugar, ginger"", whereas on the Baker's Cut is ""Baby ginger, cane sugar"". Since ingredient labels must begin with the highest-proportion ingredient and 'work downward', this isn't surprising.<br /><br />I use the Baker's Cut for cooking and will be finishing up the Penzey's by nibbling. ;-)  Not because the Penzeys is ""better"", but because the Ginger People's product has a flavor that will hold up much better when combined with other ingredients."

I'd think maybe they'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.<br />Generally Newman's Pretzels are really good, but buy these at your own risk...."

It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****"

I just wanted to rid my mouth of a club sandwich stink (it worked).

The ginseng itself is not perceptible beneath the ""peppy peppermint.""<br /><br />Texture: The light candy coating melts away to a soft chew with ginseng grit. As the crunching effect disappears the consistency becomes sinewy -- about 3-to-4 minutes -- and less enjoyable to chew. By this time, my breath is minty and I dispose of the gum.<br /><br />Packaging: If a gum company ever needed to submit itself to Amazon's Frustration-Free Packaging Trident would be the one. Most pellet packs slide into a cardboard sleeve. Trident instead chose to engineer an entire box to house nine pieces of gum. Overkill? Yes. User-friendly? No.<br /><br />Rating: Three stars.<br /><br />BTW: The American Dental Association finds that the physical action of chewing these gums for 20 minutes after eating stimulates saliva flow, which helps to prevent cavities by reducing plaque acids and strengthening teeth."

Personally, I don't want to call the manufacturers liars (they seem to be christians, and I have it on good authority that christians aren't supposed to lie), but I tried cooking this pasta on two separate occasions and both times it took way longer to cook it than stated on the box, and the results we got were (in my opinion) barely edible because the pasta was very tough and instantly stuck together when it was drained (this might be because I didn't boil it in enough water though).<br /><br />Overall, I'm giving this product 4 stars because it is very healthy, it tastes okay if you like whole grains, and the food for life people make fantastic products.  However, I will not be buying this pasta again because of the texture issue.  Personally, I would recommend bionaturae brand pasta because it is simply the best pasta I have ever had.  It's also cheaper than the food for life pasta, and is (at least according to the label) almost identical to the food for life brand on a nutritional front, although the food for life brand has more fiber and protein (and 30 more calories per serving).  I'd say buy this at the store if you REALLY want to try it before you buy 6 or 12 boxes of it."

This was our introduction to coconut cream (milk) powder to be used as an alternative to milk. Very Yummy. We will be making the switch. However, the low star rating comes from the fact that Chao Thai Brand powder (Manufactured by Korn Thai Co, LTD) has added sugar in the form of glucose syrup! According to the nutrition facts this addition adds 5 g of sugar for every 30 g serving size. I know that glucose is different than regular sugar, but for us, any added sweetener is unnecessary. Because of this discovery we are looking for a no sugar brand.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients as stated on the box:<br /><br />Fresh coconut cream - 85.20%<br />Glucose Syrup - 11.8%<br />Sodium Caseinate (Milk Protein) 2.0%<br />Silicon Dioxide - .5%<br />Dipotassium Phosphate - .5%<br /><br />That being said, if you are looking to try coconut cream powder and you do not mind the sugar this is a great product to try! We did not find any problems with grittiness, or clumping - just a smooth drink with a hint of coconut taste(not overpowering or overly tropical which concerned us). We just added the powder to hot water like we were making a cup of hot tea and then drank when cool enough.

Out of their line-up, pomegranate promises to be the most salutary because of its alleged antioxidant power and heart-friendly consequences.  How the antioxidant potency of a can of IZZE compares with unadulterated pomegranate juice (very $$$) is another question, but I prefer to imagine it's equal to a small bottle of POM (dream on).  The same question necessarily arises with IZZE apple, but in this case it's more of a challenge to rationalize chugging down an IZZE ahead of eating the once-forbidden fruit.  Besides malic acid, which is a key to making the mitochondria of the body's cells firing at their optimal best, apples are an undeniable source of some of the most essential vitamins and fiber that keep our bodies, uh, ""on task"" every day.<br /><br />I could like this better if one of the ingredients wasn't the omnipresent, practically inescapable, ""grape juice"" (it sullies practically every cranberry drink on the supermarket shelf).  But the taste is quite good (better than IZZE's pomegranate, though my wife insists that practically any IZZE tastes better in the glass bottle than in the can).  All the same, we all need at least one ""reward"" each day, and that's where an IZZE serves its purpose.  Fresh, raw apples, on the other hand, always seem less a pleasure than a duty.<br /><br />I don't recall the Bible explaining how or why the strictures surrounding the eating of apples were removed simply because our original parents ignored them--perhaps Providence deemed the removal of sanctions necessary to Newton's discovery of the earth's gravitational field.  Whatever the case, were they still forbidden, I have little doubt apples would still be highly desirable."

Unfortunately, our local, state and Federal requirements for ""organic"" foods, are severely flawed, and this product potentially  illustrates this problem quite well.<br /><br />The ingredients in these chocolate bars may meet most standards for organic foodstuffs, but there is an important element missing in the case of chocolate, that most people don't understand.<br /><br />I have read several articles recently about the high lead content of much of the chocolate that we consume, and for a period of time this problem was presumed to be that the cocoa beans themselves were (are) contaminated with lead, due to the leaded gasoline  in the engines of the farming equipment used in those countries that grow cocoa beans.<br /><br />However, some articles mention that lab analyses show that raw cocoa beans themselves have a relatively low amount of lead in them, compared to the final, processed chocolate products (and compared to other similar food products).  Some observant writers have then suggested that the high lead concentrations in cocoa products, are probably due to lead in the air near and over the drying beds, where the beans themselves are dried.  The reason for this contamination would be similar to the original theories, since there is likely high lead content in the air around these drying beds, for the prior reasoning (the lead in the gasoline used on the cocoa bean farms is emitted by tractor and other vehicle exhaust,  and then these contaminants attach themselves to the drying cocoa beans).<br /><br />At any rate, if the price of Newman's Own organic dark chocolate is as high as I suspect it is,  I would recommend buying a cheaper brand of chocolate bar (""organic"" or not), since there's no way to know whether Newman's Own chocolate has less (or more) lead in it, than other brands do."

The only cat food he would eat consistently was Whiskas canned cat food. But alas, they discontinued that product line, switching to pouches and tubs (both of which he refuses to eat).  He will eat 9 Lives from time to time, but it gives him gas and appears to be high in fat (based on the pool of fat when can is dumped out in dish).  I have desperately tried numerous brands and flavors of cats foods for a number of years, but to no avail (Some brands and flavors I could get him to eat for a day or two, but then he refuses to eat it any longer).<br /><br />Then I came across Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice at Dillon's Grocery (owned by Krogers) during a stay in Hutchinson, Kansas and he LOVES IT!  And, it appears to be fairly low in fat, which is a huge plus for an elderly cat with liver troubles (he currently has to be given Denosyl, which is also available on Amazon, to keep his liver in check).<br /><br />For those unaware, a cat with liver troubles is recommended to receive a low fat, low sodium diet, with no fish meal and no organ meat.  I've read online that vets recommend chicken and brown rice blended cat food. So, while I dont know exactly how much sodium, fat, and organ meat this product has (ingredients do list chicken liver, ocean whitefish, and sea salt), it appears to fit the bill (Ie: it doesnt have a pool of liquid fat when put in the dish) and so far my cat is doing well on this product (at long as I continue to medicate him with Denosyl, due to his liver disease - which helps protect the liver and keep the bile production down to a minimum).<br /><br />Unlike most other canned cat foods, he eats the entire can and begs for another!  Today he's eaten every bite of FIVE of the small 3oz sized cans!<br /><br />Ounce to ounce, it's a little more expensive than some canned cat foods, but well worth it in my opinion, especially since none of it is going to waste (whereas with other brands I have been going through 3-5 5oz cans of the other brands of cat food, twice a day - morning meal and evening meal - simply to find one that he will eat and then he only eats 1/2 to 2/3 of one of them for each meal, which makes for up to 9 wasted 5 oz cans a day!).  So, in the long run it's cheaper for me at least, and no headaches of trying to get him to eat something.<br /><br />I'm am extremely happy with the product and my cat is very happy with it as well."

They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%"

They need to go back down on the product. But if you're not doing a shake diet and just use this for workouts and stuff, I don't know how it's going to work you. Well I do know when you workout, you going to feel it like with any other workout but the next day, you will not be sore. That's why I love it. When I'm exercising, I feel the burn, the pain.

That said, it takes three or four of these bags to make a proper quart of sunbrewed tea, and then I still feel like it lacks real tea flavor, so I usually throw in a black or iced blend bag on top of those.  The blackberry flavor is very nice though - it is NOT sugary sweet.  Also, for those of us who like pretty food, the color is really beautiful when this is sitting in a glass pitcher.  :)"

Anyone with celiac disease or other wheat intolerance needs to know that this product, though free of wheat, is made with multiple grains, including barley flour, and so is unsuitable for their use. Rightfully, the product should be named Multigrain Fig Bars as that is what they are. I don't see why anyone would specifically choose a wheat-free product over one containing wheat unless one is wheat intolerant (and therefore intolerant to all wheat-related grains). What possible legitimate reason could there be then to name this product ""Wheat Free""? My rating of the product is based not on the product per se but on the unfortunate and misleading name Barbara's Bakery has chosen to give it. Please note also that a representative of Barbara's Bakery in a private communication to me in response to my objection to the name of this product stated there was no claim made that the product was gluten free then added that the few products Barbara's Bakery makes which it does claim to be gluten free are made in non-dedicated facilities which also process wheat. This is absurd as those products are subject to contamination with wheat and cannot legitimately be considered gluten free. It all comes down to a matter of truth in advertising.

So if your child turns it down the first time, try it again at the next meal. The fact that it's a little tart is not a bad thing. Children have a greater tolerance for tartness than adults.

The 28oz is only a few cents more,"This hot sauce has become a staple in my kitchen and replaced my bottle of Tabasco. Like Tabasco - it is primarily a cayenne pepper delivery device. A few drops add a lot of heat to any dish. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.<br /><br />While Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a vinegar note - this product has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat, yet the heat is considerable and dominates. It also lingers, on your taste buds, longer than Tabasco. There is a subtle sweetness with garlic notes to this sauce. While Tabasco can taste harsh if you add enough to a dish ---- this sauce, no matter how much you add, tastes fresh and just a bit sweet.<br /><br />I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato is simply the sun ripened chilies and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste<br /><br />I like this product and I'd recommend its purchase but I'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem, in any way, exceptional. There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles, sugar and garlic. But chiles, sugar and garlic sure beats the vinegar aftertaste evidenced in Tabasco.<br /><br />For the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to have it on hand.<br /><br />As another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably only want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon. I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this is potent stuff.<br /><br />Update (July 2010) - a formal taste test<br /><br />I put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too ""hot"" to taste<br /><br />Results: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh but sweeter note"

Then, when you are trying to pour the contents into a bowl, about a 1/4 to 1/5 of it get stuck down in the bottom and you have to dig it out with a spoon or cut the sides open and scrape it out.  Very messy process.  If they would fix the packaging, this product would be a real plus.  As it stands, I hate to use it because of the mess."

364760,B000PDY3HI,ASY25YMTIC2A9,Steve,1,2,3,1306800000,Varying Freshness Ruins What Could Be Great Popcorn,"My wife and I take movies and popcorn very seriously. Every Friday and Saturday night, after the kids are in bed, we turn out the lights, pop in a blu-ray, and sit down to a movie with popcorn and soda. For about a year or so we had been buying fresh popcorn locally, but the shop had closed down and we searched for a replacement on Amazon. We knew we wouldn't find popcorn as fresh, but we were mostly concerned with flavor. We bought a box of Great Northern popcorn.<br /><br />The box arrived and I was a bit concerned with the look of the oil in the packets... it didn't look like oil at all, but rather butter after you melt a solid stick and it cools and coagulates back into a solid. It was more yellow then orange, had a curdled/marbled look to it, and felt a bit stiff. I looked all over the packaging to find an expiration date, but there wasn't any. I checked the reviews and saw that people had said it was suppose to be solid, so I went ahead and tried it. Once the oil started heating up, it melted instantly, so everything seemed ok. Although the flavor was really good, the popcorn certainly wasn't very fresh. We figured that we were so use to the fresh local popcorn that we were being too overly critical of it, so we continued to make it every weekend.<br /><br />When we were almost out of popcorn packs, we bought Orville Reddenbacher popcorn and popcorn oil at the grocery store. The popcorn was MUCH fresher, but didn't taste anywhere near as good, so we bought another case of Great Northern from Amazon. This second case was completely different from the first. The oil in the packs was orange and actually looked like solidified popcorn oil. It was also much softer, almost like a gel. We popped a pack that night and was shocked at how much better it was... the popcorn was much fresher and simply fantastic.<br /><br />A few days later I found that a friend of ours had bought a box of Great Northern from another website and stopped eating it after the third pack. He said it was stale and not very enjoyable. I gave him a pack of ours and he loved it, so he's going to return the box he got and hope to get a fresher one.<br /><br />It's a shame that there aren't better quality controls with this popcorn... a simple expiration date on the outside of the case would assure that everyone gets a reasonably fresh supply. I added an image above to show the difference between a pack in our first box (old) and one from our second box (fresh). If you get an old case, I highly recommend returning it and getting a fresher case... it'll be the difference between getting a good bowl of popcorn and a Great one.<br /><br />If I had never bought a second case, I would have rated this 3 stars. The second case was definitely a 5-star rating, but due to the inability to tell how fresh the product is until you actually open it, I can't give it more then 3 stars. This is not Amazon's fault since they would have to open the boxes and have someone judge how good it looks prior to shipping. This is a pretty big issue since if it weren't for me, my friend would have tossed his case in the garbage and would have written Great Northern off as a low-quality brand."
59618,B000W5SLB8,A1WOMXOEX90ARI,"Avid Camper ""WS""",5,9,3,1284681600,Too Much Fat...,"Tried this, recently, (in all dry flavors) for my German Shepherd Dog.  At first, he wouldn't touch it, but after about a week, he decided he absolutely loves it.  The biggest problem is within the first month, he had gained 3 pounds, even though he was eating less than the recommended amount and less than he was previously used to eating.  Also, he had soft, oily looking stools while eating this.  He is an active, very healthy, well-exercised, older dog.  He did seem to be more ""chipper"" and health-wise, he seemed to do fine, except for the softer stools and weight gain, but reluctantly, we had to stop feeding this, exclusively, as we were feeding less and less and he was still gaining weight AND seemed hungry all the time, looking for any other food to eat.  Since he loves the taste so much, we have decided to give him only a cup or so a day, in his Kong, with his other food or as training treats and have switched him to another food.  I'm not sure I agree with the ""good for all life stages"" philosophy either.  In the old days, that was what one did, but now that we know much more about nutrition, I believe that different life stages do require different nutrient levels.  Much as humans do.  Sadly, for our dog, this can not be the only food he eats, but it will remain a part of his daily diet, since he loves it and did well, except for the fat content.  Hope this helps!"

(23) Modern methods of milling, processing and the preservation of food cause nutrient losses, eg 85% of magnesium is removed from whole wheat in the milling.""<br />Thus it is advisable to consult a qualified health care provider if a deficiency is suspected.<br />It's usually best to avoid deficiencies by a healthy diet: ""Kelp is very high in magnesium, as are whole grains, almonds, and cashews..."""

Shame on you Amazon! I thought I was getting the assortment pictured with two surprise flavors.  I spent a lot of time looking at the pictures of different listings to figure out which assortment I wanted. I received the shipment, no real complaints there, but was disappointed that 40% was French Vanilla from two different companies. Out of 35 cups that's 40% of total. I also had 6 flavors I didn't like at ALL (Holiday leftover flavors like Pumpkin Spice and Gingerbread, Spicy Eggnog).  Take 6 I don't like and didn't think I was getting (thought it was TWO random) and I really didn't save any money from buying in a store in town. I think the deception comes in the picture of k cups with two pictures of ""surprise"" flavors. I did go back and read the actual listing and to the sellers defense it says AT LEAST two random flavors.  First time Shame on ME, Second Time Shame on You AMAZON! The product SHOULDN'T be listed as a Variety Pack with specific pictures but rather listed as a GRAB BAG of random flavors from a variety of companies.  I will NOT purchase again as I am throwing away the six terrible flavors. Next time I will get with friends and have a swapping of flavors so I know what I am getting and not pay shipping!!"

I thought that it had spoiled in transit and considered returning the remaining bottles but then I noticed the very bottom line on the product label,""Enriched with Organic Lemon Juice"".  It was too much trouble to return and, while I do not totally enjoy the tartness that the lemon juice adds, it is at least still pure and organic and healthy.<br /><br />I would not have ordered the product had I known that it was not JUST carrot juice but carrot juice with ""organic lemon juice"" added to it.  Perhaps this is why the price is so very right but I feel misled.<br /><br />It takes some getting used to if you are seeking the taste of carrot juice.  Before you order this item, I would suggest you buy a small bottle of carrot juice and squeeze some lemon juice into it to preview the effect of having lemon juice flavored carrot juice."

I think i have had them with Sukiyaki too.<br /><br /> So different than other noodles. I They are clear but absorb flavors and colors of whatever is mixed with them.  I  ordered  the 6 mushroom kind. There were plenty of mushrooms. If you love mushrooms, you will probably love these too.  I don't know, I found them needing meat or chicken I guess, so am going to order the other flavors to try or maybe add my own to these. There are  a lot of noodles here and the flavor is wonderful. It is an excellent quality product, in my opinion.  My son likes them as well. He lets all his noodles set for an hour to fully absorb flavors and become more pliable. These noodles are particularly firm. He loves noodles and since we have discovered the better ones on Amazon, he will not eat the cheaper ones anymore that he use to love. They are different than egg or other types of  noodles but seem to soak up the flavors better. Very filling. I think they would also make a great side dish with other foods. Probably worth the additional cost.<br /><br />I am going to order the other flavors of crystal noodles to try."

Nuffins is definitely worth trying! Their other products are great too. Otherwise it's Bisquick or Pamelas for our family.<br /><br />The only ""con"" I can think of is the price. At $5.00+ per pound, this mix is expensive. If you agree, mark this review as helpful! Maybe the good folks at Betty Crocker will take notice."

It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought ""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!"""

This was one of those not so good ones.<br /><br />Berry was the title of the flavor and while it tasted like berries, it wasn't that good fresh berry taste.  In fact, even though I know there is real fruit in this bar, the berry taste was almost artificial.  The rest of it didn't really taste like soy to me, but it didn't taste like anything else either.  It was kind of dry and crumbly and the texture left much to be desired.  It was like chewing on nothingness with a hint of sickly sweet berry.<br /><br />The ingredients in this bar really weren't too bad.  They were whole ingredients without a lot of additives.  But I was surprised to see butter and egg in a shelf stable bar.  Makes me wonder how they did that.  The berries were Hawthorn and Wolfberry, both dried and they also included some natural flavors, so maybe that's where the fake berry taste came from.  The sweetener was brown sugar and perhaps the raisins that were included.<br /><br />This bar is gluten free, which is something, and it uses whole soy.  But for the bar being so tiny (it definitely didn't work as a breakfast substitute for me) it still had 130 calories in it.  Which seemed like too much for how little and unfilling it was.  There was also 12 grams of sugar and a few vitamins, but not many.  I would hesitate to recommend this bar as a snack, just due to the high calories, but it definitely can't be a meal replacement.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't buy more of this brand.

To give you an idea of what my taste runs to, I also drink Gloria Jean's Black Gold, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast along with an occasional Van Houtte's Honduran.  However, Emeril's was my standard cup.  But this latest bunch is nearly tasteless and watery!  It used to have a great aroma, full body, and was easily drinkable.  The only reason I didn't score it lower was because it is still not bitter or has a bad after taste.<br /><br />I am not sure what to do now.  I just put this on auto renew when I got this batch. I'm kinda' scared to keep on getting it, if it is going to stay this way. I might just cancel it and drink more Black Tiger (the most similar IMHO).  Too bad; I have frequently seen coffee quality from the same brand change in my life- and not only in the k-cups.<br /><br />Update: I tried using this on my 7.5oz instead of 9.5oz setting, and it is somewhat better.  However, it is still not nearly as flavorful as it usually was on 9.5oz.

People talk about this food as if its garbage so i did my research by a co worker who used to work for pedigree and online. The food is proccess is nasty! but if has all the vitamins and protien needed for all dogs. I checked cans at a pet store and pediagree had more vitamins and more crude protien then science diet n others. I know the food is made bad but it isnt effecting your dog. I recieved the cans unharmed just 1 was a lil bent but it wasnt a biggy n i recieved it fairly quick and my dog loves the food. I recommend this food for low income pet owners.  N pedigree may be bad but feeding your dog people food is even worse. Think about that!. Also Pedigree was the #1 dog food back in the 80S n 90s but since all these new dog food came out and research was done on the food was declared garbage. It still used in shelters.

Also, be careful when carrying this, as the top of this is resealable (yay!) with a ziplock top and this could scratch your neck if you're not a little wary. (Just saying this because I ended up with a long scratch down my neck from carrying this on my shoulder and wanted others to avoid the same fate.)<br /><br />My friend's canine is a little picky about what he eats, with dry dog food being his ""last resort"". I figured that if I could get this dog to eat and even remotely enjoy this food, then it would be a pretty good recommendation. Now while he didn't take to the Beneful like a fish to water or a cat to milk, he did eat it, which says quite a bit considering how he can be about food.<br /><br />I don't think that Beneful will become a regular addition to the dog's diet but that he eats this means that my friend will have another brand of dogfood that he can guarantee that his dog will nom on. This dog food is a little on the expensive side in the stores in my area and while I can't guarantee what the prices will be in your neck of the woods (Amazon price not withstanding since that can change rapidly sometimes), you might want to do a little pricechecking on various different dogfoods. Beneful is definitely healthier than store brand dog food, but if you're going to spend the money then there's some better stuff out there that's a little more organic and natural.  Castor & Pollux has a slightly higher protein value, for example."

I love all three varieties and am happy to say that it lasted me almost a month, although I did give a few pieces away to friends and family. If you can get it on sale here it's a great deal, especially for 6 boxes. Occasionally you can find them for cheaper individually at your local grocery store, or in bulk at a large wherehouse store, but with the Amazon Prime program I have them sent to my house in 2 days and am more than happy with the quality of the candy.

Very impressed because of the efficiency of packaging, very tightly packed. Of the 3 sets I ordered,  one set had one of the bricks with a punch hole at the bottom, seems mysterious since the clear plastic covering the 4 bricks was in no way punched and remained intact. It's just the one brick with the punch hole at the bottom. I wonder how it got that way. Anyway, this would have been 5-stars but for that. Highly recommend the coffee."

I really liked it but I don't think the rest of my family would.  The others would have put a couple of spoons of sugar and a big squeeze of lemon in it. (they like ginger-flavored hot lemonade.)<br />The flavor is much the same as slicing a couple of quarter sized slices of ginger into a cup, adding hot water, and mashing it a bit.  Then add one of those tiny scoops of stevia, or a few drops of stevia extract.<br />This product is a nice alternative for when you don't room in your pocket for ginger root and a knife. Honestly I will probably buy some for sick days.  I lived in Cambodia and the grocery shelves were always stocked with at least 6 brands of ginger drink so I do have an appropriate background to judge.  This product is at least equal to the best of them.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was not a very satisfactory trial. We were sent only one packet from the box, so there was no listing of ingredients or nutritional information.  So I can't say how many carbs and how much sugar is included.  Yes, honey is nice but honey is made of sugar, sugar, and sugar.  Many of us really need to know how much.<br /><br /> I also have to vent, and this is probably not the company that produced it, but an Amazon employee - the single packet, the size of a tea bag, was sent in a 12x18x6 inch cardboard box with six yards of bubble wrap.

The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea.

I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups.

I went with the TAJ because of the sturdy hard plastic and rubber neck and the ease of cleaning it out after each 'session'. These were both issues with the ATB. I did remove the rope IMMEDIATELY after buying it because 1) its not able to be thoroughly cleaned and 2) it is a MAJOR igastro-intestinal blockage risk should your dog injest all or some of it(I've seen this first hand, I work at a vet). Its an expensive, invasive surgery that can be easily prevented with the TAJ if you remove the rope!<br /><br />My dislikes for the TAJ are:<br /><br />*The rope. I'm still surprised that dog toy manufacturers still use rope in their products despite the documented risks to and actual deaths of beloved pets! Toys should not be a death trap. Shame on you Busy Buddy.....<br /><br />*You can't adjust the kibble opening or dispensing rate of the kibbles. My dog figured out the first day that if he picks up the base LOTS of kibbles come out. I do understand this is due in part to my removing the rope, but its still an issue. Its annoying since he's not really 'working' for the food and he's done after just a few minutes, bored again. I've had better success plugging Kong toys with peanut butter or cream cheese and freezing them.<br /><br />*My dog will only play with it on the carpet because of the noisy, yet more sturdy hard plastic. It is very noisy on our kitchen linoleum and I can't begin to imagine it on tile! Blue prefers the carpet for more silent snacking, but this means dog food on my carpet and carpet fuzzies on the TAJ :( We've sort of solved this with making him snack on a small mat/rug that can be cleaned.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I would recommend this toy to pets that are not heavy chewers, as I don't think this would stand up to pits, rotties and other heavy chewing/large breed dogs. Its also a great toy for dogs that aren't such gifted problem solvers(like my beagle) since it IS such a simple design. Also a breeze to clean and fill with the screw-on base for the owner and it will hold a good amount of kibble."

She kept on trying to take it out of my hand and bite at the container until she realized she had to lick but she did love the flavor.  The only real negative is that Jilly got ""liver breath.""  Also the ball in the container didn't spin and I had to squeeze and I got a drip or two on the floor.

One night the itch was so bad, I decided to put coconut oil on it. Wow- the itch stopped and I slept through the night. Since then, two relatives came down with scabies. They went the chemical route via their doctor. I never did. As I researched this I think one of the reasons coconut oil works for me is that the oil smothers the little critters. Instead of chemically killing them, I am drowning them in coconut oil. Plus so what if the oil gets into my blood stream! My rashes healed, my skin is soft. Now the scabies take a while to leave your body, but I just kept a small container of coconut oil and if I feel an itch, I apply it there. I also read that if you put TEA TREE Oil or Clove oil ( a few drops) and use coconut oil as a carrier it may really kill scabies. So I am using a bit of Tea Tree Oil just in case, but I feel I was being cured just by using the coconut oil.<br />I gave it four stars because of the plastic container.

This year they changed the style to the one I'm commenting on. I was disappointed with the Santa's House & Toy Shop. I bought two kits and both had broken pieces that I had to glue together before I could even begin to assemble them, not to mention the candy canes that were obviously broken before they were even packed in the kit.  Also, the pre-printed sides were backwards, leaving me to have one rough side exposed with the windows facing inward. I guess I was spoiled with the previous kits I've bought, never a problem with any of them. I usually buy three kits every year. I assemble them before Thanksgiving and as part of our Thanksgiving day tradition my three grandchildren decorate them.<br />Regardless of the quality of the kit, the kids enjoyed them which is all that<br />really matters."

I have my favorites, mostly embedded from my childhood and new varieties that are newer to the market.  I would say that Kellogg's Raisin Bran would be considered a favorite from childhood.  Therefore when I saw this new spin on ""Raisin Bran"" I was quite interested.<br /><br />This ""Raisin Bran"" has the addition of almond slivers and dusted with cinnamon.  Well I cannot express my disappointment with this cereal. First and foremost the cinnamon, I am not sure I would use the term ""dusted with cinnamon"" rather ""dumped with cinnamon"".  This is all I tasted was cinnamon and it was very, very sugary.  Secondly the almond slivers were pretty much nonexistent, which is sad considering it is promoted on the box.  Thirdly this is ""raisin"" bran right?  Where are the raisins?  Did the two scoops that Kellogg's has built their reputation on been reduced to two tablespoon scoops?  The taste itself isn't bad per se, if you love cinnamon.  I would rather just have a bowl of normal ""Raisin Bran"".<br /><br />Kellogg's did a find job with their ""Raisin Bran Crunch"" so I am not sure how they dropped the ball on this cereal.  And not for nothing, but the box that the cereal comes in itself is very small.  This seems to be the case for most companies nowadays smaller packaging, higher prices.  But in the case of this cereal there is some major deception.  The cereal is supposed to have almonds, raisins and cinnamon.  Well there are barely any almonds or raisins and tons of cinnamon.  So it appears that Kellogg's is getting away cheap with this product.  Simply by charging more, making smaller packaging and skimping on the almonds and raisins and bulking up on cinnamon and bran flakes.  I would be really surprised if this product is still on the shelf in six months."

Strong Lengths had the same good smell and left my hair feeling the same but didn't seem to be addressing my issue of hair breakage/falling out.<br /><br />Just two days ago I purchased the Damage & Color Repair line to try out.

This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish.  The caffeine content is acceptable.  The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups.  None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though.<br /><br />Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there.  My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve.  I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also.  I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors.  Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so.<br /><br />If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor.  I wish Amazon could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable.

This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers.

The oft recommended, Cafe du Monde, is definitely not the flavor.  Im not sure what chicory is, but its a funny tasting coffee, fairly mild, and no matter how long I try to filter it to get it stronger/darker, the coffee just isnt the right amount of blackness.  So I turned to Trung Nguyen, and based on recommendations from internet, friends, and the website itself, this is one of (if not the) most popular blend.  Its got a great flavor full of nuttiness and sure presses better than du Monde (almost no grounds at bottom of cup), but its still not the ca phe sua da Im used to.  For one, the color is a definite brown, not black and it isnt strong.  Ill give the Creative #1 a try which says its a dark and strong robusta coffee (no blend), compared to this which is a blend of nearly everything.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a great tasting coffee full of complex flavors that are beyond what I can describe, give this a try... you wont be disappointed to the least.  But, if you are looking for that really strong, jet black coffee that can strip paint off a car and wake up dirt, and that when mixed with condensed milk turns into a rich golden-brown concoction that is ca phe sua da, then you need to look elsewhere (like that Creative #1... possibly)."

Some treats on the market today range from hard to soft and chewy.  I would classify these treats as somewhere between those two ranges.  The bites have an appearance and texture of a ½ inch cardboard disc that was easily broken up into smaller pieces.  Of particular interest to us was the ingredients of the treat and we were happy to see that all the ingredients (other than the preservatives) were natural food products.  An added bonus for us was the fact that this treat is made in the USA.<br /><br />In our house, we do ""controlled"" feeding; meaning that each dog is given a portioned amount of dog food at the same time twice a day.  This is in direct opposition to ""free"" feeding (having food available at all times throughout the day).  They are all fed in their crated kennel.  Our cats are free fed; with the food on a perch out of the reach of the dogs.<br /><br />A total of 8 dogs and 2 cats were tested for this review.  Five of the dogs and both cats are ours and 3 of the dogs were visiting at the time this testing took place.  The breed of dogs tested were 3 Welsh Pembroke Corgi's, 2 Border Collie adults, 1 Belgian Sheep dog, 1 Border Collie mix puppy and 1 Golden Retriever.  Four dogs are female and four dogs are male.  Six of the dogs are highly food driven, one is somewhat picky of what it eats and the last dog is very picky of what it eats.  The cats are of no particular breed and both are female.  All dogs tested were fed 2 hours prior to testing.<br /><br />We wanted a controlled testing environment whereby each dog was given the opportunity to visit a small bowl of 1 Raw Boost Bite that was broken up into smaller pieces than the original.  Each dog, one at a time and alone, was taken out of their crated kennels and let loose inside of the house.  Each dog easily found the treat.  The 3 Corgi's, the Border Collie puppy mix, 1 of the Border Collies adults, and the Golden Retriever (a total of 6 of the 8 dogs) immediately feasted on the treat and thoroughly enjoyed the treat.  All of these dogs are highly food driven.<br /><br />The other Border Collie adult sniffed the treat, went away for about 30 seconds and returned to the treat bowl and ate each piece but not nearly as vigorously as the other 6 dogs.  This dog is pretty ""picky"" of what it eats and is not food driven at all.  The Belgian Sheepdog is very picky of what it eats and after one sniff, refused to even try the treat.<br /><br />My two cats live a relaxed life style of sitting on the couch and since they are not trained will only eat soft food.  They both took one look at Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Chicken flavor and walked away.<br /><br />In conclusion, we were pleased with this product.  Boost Bites do not get a perfect rating because one of my dogs and the cats did not want to eat them.  After the response most of the dogs had to this product, I will be ordering these again for them to act as an obedience training tool."

Then make a batch of caramelized onions (see the first part of Julia Child's French Onion Soup recipe)  and add a spoon or two of brown sugar.

I can tell that they use Splenda (or something other than real sugar) because the ""sweet"" taste that's found in most sodas is just not there.<br /><br />All of that aside, most of the flavors DO taste similar their counterparts (Fountain Mist = Mountain Dew, Lemon Lime = Sprite, etc.) I would recommend getting the Variety Pack to find which things you like before you buy a bottle that makes 12 liters."

The bow is attractive enough to save, and the basket holds a good variety, from biscotti to candy.  The frustration-free packaging was easy to open and protected the contents very well.<br /><br />The contents made nice snacks paired with coffee, with flavors running from very good to just so-so.  The Cashew Roca is delicious, as Roca-brand treats always are, to my taste.  The chocolate chip cookies barely earn the name, as they are very sandy shortbread (a texture unlike any I expect when I think ""chocolate chip cookies"") with tiny, scarce chips too small even to taste chocolaty.  The fudge is tasty, although there are only two small pieces.<br /><br />Therein lies my chief complaint:  All of the items are very over-packaged for the amount of food they actually contain, making the basket appear much more generous than it actually is.  For example, the fudge box measures 3 x 4 inches (that's it on the right in the picture of the filled basket), containing two pieces of fudge that measure just over an inch square:  12 square inches of box for about 2 inches of fudge.  The Roca box (on the left in the picture) is 6 x 3-1/2 inches, with three small pieces of Roca in it.  The cookie box was about 24 square inches, containing 2 ounces of itsy-bitsy cookies (each is about the size of a quarter).<br /><br />There is no dishonesty in advertising here, as the basket clearly lists contents of just 11.9 ounces.  However, the appearance is one of a large, bountiful basket full of treats, but it actually doesn't contain very much once all the packaging is disposed of.<br /><br />At the right price, I would suggest this as a nice, small gift with an interesting variety of treats -- emphasis being on small."

It does take 30 minutes to cook, but following the directions on the can (4 cups water, 1 cup oats) this makes four breakfasts (just under 1 cup of cooked oats each) for me; it might make 5 for smaller appetites.<br /><br />I make it in the evening by starting with the water and oats, with just a touch of salt in the water. Stir the oats initially, then set a timer and leave it be on very low heat (just barely bubbling). At the end of 30 minutes, stir well, then I divide the oatmeal into 4 equal parts (usually just under 1 cup each) and put it into those little Glad Serv-n-Saver type containers (the ""Tupperware"" you don't mind losing!). Into each container (""bowl"") I like to mix a handful of raisins (or other dried fruit, but raisins are my personal favorite), a dash or two of cinnamon, about a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of ground flax seed. I then mix each thoroughly and cover; then all 4 ""ready to heat and serve"" bowls go into the fridge.<br /><br />Each morning, then, I pour about a tablespoon of skim or soy milk on top of the oatmeal, then microwave for 1min 20sec (your oven may vary, of course). Stir, and enjoy; I eat it right out of the Serv-n-Saver bowl, which cuts down on washing, too! It's a wonderful tasting, quick and HEALTHY part of your breakfast. It's high fiber, so it's filling, which tends to cut your overall caloric intake and it goes a long way toward the American Heart Association's recommended daily fiber serving; most Americans are woefully below this in their usual diet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as a part of a healthy, low-fat, low calorie, low glycemic and high fiber diet.

Pricing is excellent! Each box clocks in at 1 pound and 9 ounces, and you get two boxes in the package, for an amazing $33.18 with free shipping. I live in Utah and it is mid-April now - I didn't get any hard or deformed chocolates.<br /><br />Taste is very good! Creamy, almost buttery center, with a fragrant vanilla white chocolate shell. I wonder if Lindor and Leonidas are related somehow? Leonidas is a Belgian company and Lindor is Swiss, but it appears that they are mimicking each other through this white chocolate. However, make no mistakes! Leonidas is the clear winner here! The so-called ""truffles"" center of Lindor's chocolate is completely synthetic flavoring - there are no true white truffles according to the ingredients on the box. As far as I know, there are no synthetic flavorings for Leonidas Manon Blanc and Manon Cafe. For those who have tasted both companies' chocolates, there is a slight hint of salt in Lindor's creamy center whereas Leonidas' is a heavenly creamy butter. Besides these differences, Lindor's makes a great substitute to Leonidas for those who do not wish to splurge every month on decadent chocolates.<br /><br />Lastly, I'll close with a warning for those who are still wavering about buying this chocolate. It will not help you lose weight (but it will make you very happy)! Just three balls of Lindor's contains 70% of your recommended servings of saturated fat. This type of fat can be good or bad for you depending on your health. The good news is that there is zero trans fat - the really bad kind - and only 5mg of cholesterol (2% of recommended daily doses). Sodium levels clock in at 1% for the 3 balls. You also get a decent dose of fiber, protein, calcium, and vitamin C, according to the box. So if you don't already have an exercise routine, these bonbons can make you really fat (which is true of any good chocolate)!"

It's a little subtle at times, almost to the point where I would've missed if it I wasn't specifically looking for it. This isn't a game killer, as I actually don't like a strong vanilla taste with my vanilla flavored items. Those wanting something more pronounced will probably be disappointed.

They responded within one business day. Below is an excerpt of their response to me. I thought other parents would appreciate this information.<br /><br />""I can tell you that this is a wholly organic, minimally processed product, and as such, it's subject to slight changes in the organic crop year, season, etc.  Also, since this is drum dried (thin film on a hot steel rolling dryer), changes in drum temp can occasionally cause more browning than normal.  Also, this product (BELLIES cereal) is on what's called a ""positive release"" program, which means that product cannot be released for sale until the required testing comes back acceptable.  The fact that it was for sale tells me it passed those tests...<br />Right now, I feel as though rough handling (trucks, forklifts, shelf stockers, etc.) has caused damage, most likely leading to a seam leak.  Since we flush the can with nitrogen, a seam leak allows air (oxygen) into the can, which can cause a set of oxidation reactions.  These are responsible for off flavours/colours/odours, but other than that, are harmless, and do not pose a food safety threat to your son.""<br /><br />I believe in this product and their commitment to customers.

This product does have several hair oils including mineral, coconut, palm,sweet almond oil, sunflower, soybean, argan oil and shea butter.<br /><br />Just like cooking oils, some are good for you, some are not, but any kind of oil is going to be oily.<br /><br />My suggestion is to pour a few drops of the oil into the palm of your hands, and rub your hands together before running them through your hair, because if you are going to go right for your scalp, yes it's going to make your hair look greasy, oily.<br /><br />I have very thick long hair, so the amount you might want to use may be different, but I started with about a nickel size, and ran it through my hair, starting on the ends first, then applied the rest to my scalp, and ran my brush through my hair to spread the scalp and hair oil evenly.  You can always add more if you find you need to.  You may not need to.  It's always easier to start with less and add as needed.<br /><br />It left my hair feeling soft.  I don't use hair conditioner anymore in the shower since I have been using these kinds of products.<br /><br />Next time I think I would use alittle less of this for my hair.  I also think that if smell is really an issue for you, using less of this product will not make the smell as intense, at least until you get used to it, to see if you really like the scent.<br /><br />I smell everything before I buy it, because if I don't like the scent of something Iam not going to use it.<br /><br />The scent of this scalp and hair oil, it reminds me of pina coladas, or suntan oil, which I think is an appropriate scent for this type of product.<br /><br />The bottle is 3 ounces, which I think makes this type of product last for a very long time, since you probably won't need to use alot of it each time you use it."

It's a strong red (black) tea in what is allegedly an espresso grind, but tea doesn't really grind the way coffee beans do and so it just makes a lot of very small, hard to filter bits.<br /><br />This grind of tea needs to be in an espresso machine or else you will get floaties.  I tried this tea three ways: espresso, regular drip coffee, and loose in boiling water and strained later.  It had to be strained 3 times to get most of the floaters out of it, and while I'm okay with some actual tea leaves in other brands occasionally making it into the cup, this fine grain floaty stuff really put me off for some reason.  When you make it as you do espresso coffee, however, you really concentrate the taste and it becomes nearly undrinkable.<br /><br />The taste was the same every time, very strong, bitter to the point of smelling a bit dirty, with an acidic sweetness that lingered on the tongue for ages.  My husband grabbed the grounds the first time and literally ran them outside, and immediately cleaned the coffee pot to make sure the taste did not affect the machine later.  He adamantly refused to even be in the house when I attempted the tea twice more.<br /><br />For people like us who like nothing in our tea except maybe a little lemon, a tea like this that must be doctored heavily isn't really our thing anyway.  But one of the reviews here recommended the tea for Thai Iced Teas, which I tried.  That was the best result of the 3 attempts at using the tea, but I still like the kinds of teas you can get in restaurants or international food stores much better than this tea.<br /><br />We're big tea drinkers in this house, and at any given time have at least 7 types of tea in the house.

Yes, it's convenient and non-messy to carry around. For my dog, the low-calorie aspect isn't necessarily a good thing. For example, when I take her on a hike, she runs around like crazy, so I actually want her to get some calories from her treats. The other times I give her treats, I'm usually giving her something chewy that will help remove dental plaque. So overall, this isn't a great option for my particular dog.

At first we thought there was something wrong with her, she wouldn't do normal crazy kitten things. After reading about cat nutrition, I discovered what I had fed to my cats as a kid was completely backwards, as is most 'cat food' even today. I read about BFF and decided to let her try some. Now my cat doesn't rest all day, but is playful and as crazy as a kitten should be. Also of note, there is much more urine in her litter box each day, which is a good sign of how much water is in the food. She's also volunteering her presence more now, not just when she is hungry. I had to take a star off, not because of the product, but since Amazon doesn't let me order more than 2 packs per flavor. I'd give it 6 stars if I could 'subscribe' as you can with other types of food on Amazon.<br /><br />Also, I would recommend the 3oz cans if you have only one cat. You will have to feed him/her more throughout the day, but it can dry out if they don't finish it, which defeats some of the purpose besides being unappetizing to the cat."

I add fried sweet potatoes and garden serranos.  Sort of like a moderately hot salsa, there's an instinct to just keep eating it.  It isn't so hot that it is unpleasant to eat and it doesn't have any chili flavor of its own.<br /><br />You can eat it with a marinara and I do, seasoning it with red pepper flakes.  I'm not a heat freak by any stretch and neither are my dinner guests, but the kick is a welcome alternative and the foundation for many great dishes.  This also goes well with an alfredo or other cream sauce.  I wouldn't recommend it for something Mediterranean styled full of delicate flavors such as capers and olive oil.  Whether it goes well with pesto or is sort of a waste of pesto is debatable.  It's a great base to Indian dishes with goat cheese and lots of fresh vegetables like squashes, zucchini, cauliflower, and so on.<br /><br />Rossi Pasta's website has this same size at the same price.  (I keep trying to order on it, but it makes you recover the password for the account you didn't want to create each time and then still can't process the order.  It might be one of those ""it only works with IE"" deals that works for most people, but just barely.)<br /><br />As long as I'm griping, I'd like to see a bit better price on this bulk size.  $5/pound is pretty steep for pasta.  The gourmet, hand-made stuff in the unaffiliated corner organic grocery has some delicious locally made pasta in small quantity for the same price per pound.  I do buy that sometimes, but I'm hooked on the unique possibilities of Rossi's Fire Pasta."

Made my dog Sick!!!,"I am writing this review to warn other dog owners of Blue Buffalo for dogs and what it has done to my  5 yr. old Miniature Dachshund named ""Calla"".  Back in late October 2011 I switched to Blue Buffalo after it was recommended by a family member. By mid-November Calla started to cry out at night.  We thought it might be a back issue and our ""Three"" yes three Vets agreed that it could be Intervertebral Disc Disease.  We had blood work done in November and everything looked fine with the exceptions that she was a ""little"" dehydrated. After months of treatments, with little to no improvement we thought it might be a stomach issue and I started to think about the timing of the change to Blue Buffalo, then I went and goggled ""Consumer complaints about Blue Buffalo Pet Foods"" and started to really connect the dots.  Yesterday she was diagnosed with ""Pancreatitis"" and needs to be in the hospital for days for treatment.  I have spent over 3K to this point and do not know if Calla will ever recover fully from this.  She was a completely healthy dog before we changed to Blue Buffalo and since have been living in Hell with nighty episodes.  Please read up on this issues people are having with this product before you buy. I wish I could give a product -minus 5 stars!!!!"

I keep it in my pocket.Since it has a cap and has plastic construction, it doesnt get crushed in my pocket.

With the lickey stik he was very eager to see the stik come out.<br /><br />A few notes on the Lickety Stik's use.  The first time you use the Lickety stik, you may have to move the roller-ball with your fingers to get the treat to flow a little.  Once the dog understands that licking the ball makes the treat flow, it is not an issue. Also when he is done licking, there is no dripping.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik also has a clear window at the base of of the bottle so you know when it is time to reorder.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik is not large which makes it easy to trasport.

I have tried them several times now, altering the amount of syrup to see if it would make a difference, and each time I end up pouring it down the drain. I am SO disappointed by this as I had high hopes for flavorings."

I have no idea how long ago this was packed together.  Nothing appears to be stale.<br /><br />The packaging was a plain cardboard box with a thin cardboard insert that takes up the length & width of the box, in an attempt to make it look like there's a wrapped Christmas package inside.  The whole thing was nicely protected for shipping.<br /><br />I've never had Cheese Straws before and wasn't sure what to expect.  They seem to be a cross between a thick cracker and a cookie.  These are Aged Cheddar by Sonoma Cheese.  The taste is pretty strong and be prepared for a hot feeling in your mouth afterward.  The package contains 2 servings.<br /><br />Three Pepper Water Crackers contains 4 servings that have the pepper visible on the crackers.  A thin, dry cracker that has a mild taste.<br /><br />Sonoma Jacks Parmesan Peppercorn gourmet cheese wedges have 6 individually wrapped wedges.  The main ingredients listed are Monterey Jack and Parmesan cheese.  A somewhat plastic/rubbery texture, although the taste is okay; nothing special.  A small cheese knife/spreader is included.<br /><br />Beth's Chocolate Chip Cookies are bite-sized with 2 servings.  The cookies appear to have a somewhat breaded coating on them that poured out of the package as crumbs.  The cookies themselves were intact and I liked the taste.<br /><br />Brown & Haley Cashew Roca.  These were really good and are doubly wrapped for freshness.  Too bad there are only 3 in the package.<br /><br />Nunes Farms Roasted Almonds with Sea Salt.  I generally eat plain almonds so I was happy to find that the salt is very light and added just enough to make these more interesting.  3 servings per package.<br /><br />1 sleeve of Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Hot Cocoa Mix.  I'm saving this for later.<br /><br />2 Ghirardelli Chocolate squares with Caramel filling.  It's Ghirardelli.  Enough said.<br /><br />1 Napa Valley Mustard Co Hot Sweet Mustard.  Label claims it's rich with honey; the main ingredient is sugar but honey is listed in there as well.  I really don't understand why this was included in the box.  There isn't anything to try it out on so this hasn't been tasted yet.<br /><br />As of this writing the price appears to be $39.99.  I just can't see myself purchasing this as a gift at that price."

An ""A"" for effort, though.","Edit:<br /><br />In some markets (or possibly all, and it hasn't reached the town I live in yet) General Mills has reportedly taken off the ""Gluten Free"" label.<br /><br />I'm so sad.  Now I can't sue.  That would have been a really fun class action lawsuit.<br /><br />Original review:  A lot of celiacs get sick from this.  If you are feeding this to a small child with celiac who won't really be able to tell you so, you might want to reconsider.<br /><br />While I applaud the efforts of General Mills, I think they have a learning curve:  various websites have celiacs complaining of 'being glutened' by this.<br /><br />Personally, I actually called General Mills to complain about getting sick after eating this;  they told me they test for gliadin, which is the gluten in wheat.  What they didn't say, is whether they run these cereals on lines of oat cereals.  Avenin, the gluten in oats, cannot be tolerated by 25% of celiacs.<br /><br />So, either this isn't entirely gluten free of wheat proteins, or it's not avenin (oat gluten) free.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />Edit:  STILL not gluten-free.  There are more comments from more and more people on the celiac boards about getting sick from this.  Wow.

""Forbidden rice?""<br /><br />There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.<br /><br />What is sold as ""forbidden rice"" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.

Now with kids of my own, I decided to make Shake and Bake for my kids to try too.  The response was as good as I remember that I had - it's crispy and delicious!  Shake and Bake is really easy to make: simply put the Shake and Bake in a plastic bag, wet your chicken a little and toss in and SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE!  Bake it for about 45 minutes at 400 degrees and you'll end up with some crispy ""almost like fried"" chicken.  The flavor isn't too salty, and leans more on the mild side.  If you like it a little spicier, rub on a little tabasco before coating the chicken.<br /><br />This version of Shake and Bake doesn't come with the shaker bag included.  You will need to either 1) have a ziploc bag to put the chicken in, or you can just put the S&B in a pie dish (or other shallow dish) and coat it that way.  We don't like using too many bags, so we just used a large bowl and tossed the chicken around until coated.<br /><br />For people who are having problems with getting soggy bottoms on your chicken, an easy way to keep that from happening is to crumple up the foil and put the chicken on top.  This creates some air pockets under the chicken so that less of it is sitting on the foil.  If you're using chicken wings, you won't even have to crumple the foil because most of the chicken is off the pan.  You can also use a wire rack to make the whole chicken crispy.  Each pack can coat about 6 pieces (we did 2 each of wings, thighs, and drumsticks and had a little left over in the bowl)."

None of the dents look like it was actually punctured. Still, the dents near the top made it impossible to open the can. So messy and sticky. Storing this thing is also a pain in the arse. Unless you plan to bake 5 pies and use the whole thing, the packaging is just plain horrible. It looks like it belongs in the 50s and is so outdated. It's not like it's a quarter or something extremely cheap, I don't understand why they can't update the packaging to make it more user friendly. Will buy a squeeze bottle next time. Actually I wanted to buy the squeeze bottle in the first place but the organicness made me think it was worth an entire extra $10 can opener purchase.<br /><br />If you want to use this for just coffee like me, stay away and get the squeeze bottle.

The amount of sauce works perfectly for the amount of pasta with a portion size that is good for lunch.  Add a small side salad and and a piece or two of garlic bread and this could easily work as an evening meal.<br /><br />Preparation is quick and easy.  1 minute or so (may need longer in smaller microwave ovens) to a hot meal.  I appreciated the sauce being in a separate, removable, container in the package both for mixing with the pasta and the ability to heat it separately an additional few seconds if desired.  Frankly, this design is what keeps the pasta cooked properly as it's not sitting in the sauce on the shelf becoming softer with time.  Just be careful pulling that cover off as it's very well attached and if not removed with caution can easily create a lunch disaster with hot sauce covering everything.<br /><br />Yes, you could make your own for less money but it's comparable in price to competing, less flavorful, products and less expensive than similar dishes at corporate fast-food establishments.<br /><br />Overall a very tasty and convenient product for portable meal needs."

While I don't consider myself a coffee snob, I know what I like.<br />One Love, according to the package, is Organic coffee and Fair Trade Certified, and a piece of the family dream,  which I don't mind standing up for. I still harbor a fondness for the music of the Marley men, and it was with great anticipation that I tossed a pod of One Love into my coffee maker.  For me the coffee was more on the light side of medium. Actually, it tasted on the light side of light.  I prefer a dark bold flavor but don't mind a good medium roast. The package also said Exotic Floral and Berry. Try as I might, I just couldn't pick the Floral and Berry notes or much of a coffee flavor and strangely, no real fragrance. Honestly, I could take it or leave it. I wouldn't recommend this."

So, I recommend this, but I would HIGHLY recommend getting some Chebe too and cutting the Bisquick with it.

The so-called ""dark chocolate"" is a paste-like frosting that, being chocolate, obviously should taste good, but has a weird texture that makes it gross.  I was thinking it was going to be like a layer of actual chocolate, similar to the layer of chocolate on the bottom of Kashi's Go-Lean Crunch bars (which are totally yummy), not chocolate flavored frosting on the top of the granola bar.  Second, these do NOT taste like coconut at all.  There is a sprinkling of dried coconut on the top of the nasty frosting, but you can't even taste it, mostly because the chocolate-y taste of the paste, uh, I mean frosting overwhelms it.  My kids won't even eat them and they will eat anything with frosting on it.  Actually, I guess now I have to say they will eat ALMOST anything with frosting on it.

The rim sits perfectly in my Keurig machine. When you close the lid of your machine, the product is punctured from the top only. The filter is sort of bowl-shaped and doesn't make contact with the lower puncture needle, but you really wouldn't want it to puncture a filter anyway - you'd have grounds in your coffee. It's a clever idea, actually.<br /><br />I was skeptical about this product because the box doesn't have the ""Keurig"" co-branding that all the others do, but given the variation to the cup design, I can now understand why. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The taste was quite good and strong, and is the closest thing to real coffee-pot coffee that I've had in 3+ years of Keurig machine cup samplings. I had no coffee grounds in the cup, and it was quite satisfying.<br /><br />By way of background, my all-time favorite variety is Tullys French Roast, and I prefer dark roasts. The box for San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser says its a combination of their regular roast and their french. Its not as strong as Tullys French but it's definitely not weak. My machine is the B77 model which has 4 size settings. Going from small to large, I used the third size which is 7.25 ounces and I was very satisfied with the taste and strength.<br /><br />I wanted to start with the small 12 count box at the market to try them out.

That is, until I received this last order of 4 packs this week. All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor -- my dog, who was usually so excited to get one of these treats, left it on the floor untouched.

They were all extremely greasy and salty. They smelled horrible. I managed to eat most of the Mattar Paneer when I mixed it with rice, but the others were inedible, mostly because of the can taste, as well as that the ingredients (vegetables, paneer etc.) being completely liquefied/mush from a can.

I noticed that there are fewer tea leaves in the individual bags as well (this was obvious to the naked eye, comparing with the previous tea bags), so it's not as potent as the original.  The old tea bags used to be generous in terms of how much tea was in each bag, and it made a perfect cup of tea.  The new ones are skimpy and one tea bag will not be enough.

For me, the water is basically tasteless, and I actually prefer the taste of natural spring water (for example, Crystal Geyser or Calistoga).  However, the water tastes very clean, and anyone who is very particular about what he/she ingests will probably love this water.<br /><br />Essentia's selling point is its 9.5 pH.  According to my online research, ordinary tap water is more acidic, with an average 7 pH.  The Mayo Clinic reports that proponents of alkaline water claim it can neutralize acid in the bloodstream, boost energy and metabolism, improve absorption of nutrients, slow the aging process, slow bone loss, and help with disease resistance.  However, the Mayo Clinic also states that these claims have not been verified by researchers.  Debunkers of alkaline water health claims point out that Kansas City tap water has 11 to 12 pH, and that KC residents are no healthier than people in the rest of the U.S.<br /><br />Essentia is purified by reverse osmosis.  Wikipedia explains that reverse osmosis is a filtration method that removes large molecules and ions from solutions by applying pressure to force a solution through a membrane.<br /><br />I rate Essentia water at 4 stars, because it tastes very pure.  However, it is up to the individual to decide whether the water is worth the price, especially as compared to bottled spring water, or to ordinary tap water that is filtered with an attachment (for example, the very good <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006WNMI"">Culligan Faucet Filter</a>) or a pitcher equipped with a charcoal filter (for example, the excellent <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041LF3HE"">3M Filtrete Water Pitcher</a>)."

It also uses cane juice and molassesm as sweeteners, with no artificial crap (though does have added vitemin e).<br /><br />So it's pretty healthy, reletively speaking. Still, it's food and taste is what matters -- and on that note it's pretty average. It's a nice mix of sweet and oaty, and I admit I wouldn't have trouble eating it as a long term minching snack. At the same time, though, nothing about it particularly stands out. Combined with the fact that it costs over 50 cents an oz, pretty high for a simple snack food, it's not something I could recommend unless you're a complete health nut."

I don't know about everyone else, but we are not friends with our alarm clock.  We have a slap fight every morning with it until we realize we must obey if we want to keep our jobs.  Needless to say, there is no time for breakfast before we rush out the door.<br /><br />This is where these cookies come in very handy.  The first time we bought them we kept them in our pantry (I think we bought 60 that time to try a variety of flavors).  Unfortunately, by the time we reached the last dozen, they had gone bad and were a bit fuzzy.  Now this is actually a good thing!  Mold can't grow without moisture, so this tells you the cookies are moist!  Because they are all natural and are not made with preservatives, it is only reasonable that they would have a shorter shelf life.<br /><br />Next order we popped a weeks worth in the fridge and put the rest in the freezer.  We did this because my husband likes to eat them in morning traffic on his way to work so frozen cookies wouldn't work for him.  I on the other hand work in a very small office so I brought a variety to work and put them in our freezer.  In the morning I just pop one into the microwave for 45 seconds and I have a warm, tasty breakfast.  I especially like the gooeyness of the melted caramel and chocolate from those varieties.<br /><br />At an average of 300 calories it is a good meal alternative and is very filling.  It is a nice alternative to drinking a slim fast for breakfast, though I do sometimes still do Slimfast for breakfast and have a cookie for lunch.<br /><br />I would like to see them come in a variety dozen.<br /><br />[...]"

So, for me, Neuro Sleep isn't worth it. It could possibly be a contender if it kept me asleep for at least 8 hours, but it doesn't. Looks like I need to find something else to help me get off Ambien.<br /><br />(Also, the taste is not particularly great either!)"

After a bad experience with a tennis ball (that he got hold to) and his intestinal tract, I've been very selective about the toys I give him. A lot of the other pet owners that reviewed here had pets on the upper end of that 50lb scale and my Boston (at adult development) is only around 20lbs, if that. So, I thought I'd give this a try and watch out for complete destruction of the toy. Well, from day 1 when we received this he took to it immediately. I don't know if this has a flavor, but he didn't touch any of the other toys we received the same day... only this one. And, he's chewed on it every day now for about 4 months.  Only recently did I begin to notice that he'd finally broken through a corner and I tossed the toy. That white plastic can kill his intestinal organs if it gets in there.  So, for the price vs. the length of time it lasted and he enjoyed it without cause, it's an ""ok"" toy. I'm going to buy him another one, but I think the key is to stay vigilant and be sure that once your pet seems to start puncturing through this, it needs to be thrown out immediately. Since he is quite literally never alone, this is not as big an issue as it may be for other pet owners.  Please keep this in mind before buying!"

No bugs were apparent when the shipment arrived a couple or so months back.  When I found them inside the Dreamfields, the bugs were crawling over other items, speckled on the pantry ceiling, and had gotten inside a few other opened packages (especially a box of Milk Bone), but only this pasta had them inside unopened boxes (which were still semi-wrapped in plastic), as I said.  Thus I must conclude that this batch was the original source.  The boxes immediately went in the trash, would be unfair to try to return them, but since I'd only used 2 boxes when this was discovered, it was a big waste of money!  It took 4 hours and two of us to go through everything in the pantry, I promise I would never accuse any product specifically unless I had a pretty good idea of what happened.<br />Any way, love the product, it does not ever seem to spike my blood sugar, but I guess I won't be buying it in bulk again, even though it seems so convenient, because in the end it was horribly inconvenient and an expensive loss."

Eight O'Clock's Columbian (my most-brewed in the AM coffee) is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste, again at 2/3 the price.

The one thing I missed was peanut butter!! It is very costly on the weight loss system that Weight Watchers established, Points Plus. When I saw it on Dr Phil's show, I was curious, ordered it and was I HAPPY. Mixing it with water, the recommended serving is 1 point, regular peanut butter can be as much as 5 points. When using sugar free jam or syrup to mix the powder in, the taste is wonderful and has the consistency of peanut butter, thanks to whom ever developed this product,for someone like myself, trying to get healthier,well this is just a blessing. I encourage anyone who is a peanut butter lover like me, and would like to have the taste without all of the fat and calories, GO FOR IT."

I bought a box of the Sweet Ginger Chicken w/ Bananas & Coconut based on the reviews and the overall appeal of the name.  We are now feeding them to our dog, which is appropriate because it looks, smells and tastes like dog's dinner.  Looks: Dark and mealy- so dark that it seems like it must be organ meats (which I have no problem with if it didnt taste awful).  Smells: the smell is so strong the second you open the pouch and VERY much like a can of cat or dog food. Tastes: I taste all of the baby food I give my daughter.  It was pungent and metallic, where the banana and coconut were, lord only knows.  If you must try it, I get it I would too, just buy a packet or two and see how it goes.  Do not buy a case.  On a side note, my dog loves it! So no a total loss.<br /><br />In general the sprout meals are delicious and the texture on the level 3's are chunkier than Plum or Happy Tot.  You can see bit of veg and grains.  Holiday Veg w/ Turkey is a big hit as is the Pumpkin Peach Graham (I serve together but not mixed).  Roasted Banana Mango is really yummy and she LOVES the Yukon Golds with Squash and Parmesan.<br /><br />Beyond Sprout, we prefer:<br /><br />Fruits and Veg: Ellas for a richer consistency and better flavor than Plum or Happy Tot.  Parsnip, Carrot, Apple is a surprise hit. Plum fruits are watery and water is even listed as first ingredient on some. However, the Plum Mish Mash line is much better and my daughter eats all of it.<br /><br />Breakfast: Happy Squeeze (tot) Organic Super Smoothies are awesome, in fact, I'm going to start having them for breakfast myself.  ALL of them taste excellent! Have 100% adult dv of vitamin C, 1/2 vitamin A. 6 grams or so of protein and under 100 cals.  They are thick, and creamy.<br /><br />Dinner: Plum Training Meals seem to be her favs along with the Sprout brand (other than the curry chicken) We have yet to try the salmon but have a case of it ready to go.  She likes the potato and turkey with rosemary (tastes like an herby mash potato) and the chicken pasta (not something an adult would like but I think she likes the texture of the visible chunks of pasta).  My girl has never been able tohave abottle more than 100ml but can eat a whole 4oz training meal.  GO figure!<br /><br />We have landed on plain cherrios vs the canisters which she lost interest in.  Straeberry mum mums NOT caramel or plain and teething bisuits above those.<br /><br />I cant beleieve how much baby food has evolved in a year.  I heat up breakfast and dinner and serve lunch icy cold.  She seems to like the changes.  I got the plum spoon that screws on for when we ar on the go but as a rule, the playtex spoons with silicone are THE BEST!!!! and I have a drawer full. I hope this helps, we really have tried all the snacks and foods we could get our hands on in store and online."

From product analysis, kcal analysis, ingredients, customer reviews, professional reviews, company recalls - all of it... I have become a mini-expert in the field.<br /><br />I was pushed into becoming an expert because my yellow Lab kept having seizures and I couldn't figure out the source.  I finally learned it was her food, which was the most expensive store bought brand my local Sams Warehouse carries.  I thought I was giving her the best, it looked fresh and rich, but it turns out it was just absolutely terrible food.  My black Lab also had terrible skin allergies, to the point where I would get a small rash on my skin if he laid next to me on the couch for more than 5 minutes at a time.  I had no clue it was because of the food.  But it was!<br /><br />Since having that epiphany and learning so much about dog food, I've always made sure to feed them the highest quality grain free food I can buy.  This Taste of the Wild (TOTW) fits the bill very nicely, and they love it.  Since switching to a grain free diet, the yellow lab has not had any more seizures in over a year, and the black lab has the silkiest coat you've ever seen and his skin allergies are completely gone.<br /><br />They are on 2/3rds dry and 1/3rd wet combination.  Contrary to what I had previously been raised to believe, a wet diet is not bad for dogs but in fact is superior!  I use the combination to save money while providing them the best I can.<br /><br />Before deciding on TOTW, I had also tried Blue Buffalo, Wellness Core, and Orijen.  Briefly: they are all good foods, but my labs were happiest on TOTW and my wallet is also happiest on TOTW.  I also believe TOTW has a better formulation for them and their life style (some of the products, like Orijen, are simply too rich for the average household dog, despite being made of the best ingredients available).<br /><br />Enter TOTW.  The dry food is dark and rich, with no sign of crumbling.  The kibble is a good average size.  The wet food has nice chunks of meat and the right amount of gravy.  I use the wet food as a topper to mix the 2/3rd dry and 1/3rd wet together for their meals.  I use one whole can of wet per meal with my pack, which is convinient so I don't have to store it in the refrigerator - btw, never store canned dog food in the fridge in the original aluminum container!<br /><br />I still wish I could find a less expensive product with the same quality, but in the mean time, TOTW is the best choice for my pack."

My earlier experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant,or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. For me it was coffee, coffee, and more coffee.<br /><br />However,hearing so much about the benefits of green tea,I picked out a box of it at the store and put it up on my shelf.It just sat there. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM68QG"">Good Earth Tea Green Tea, Lemongrass, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> -see my review for details of the Lemongrass - I loved it. It was the best I tried. Naturally I found the best deal here at Amazon.<br /><br />Next I wanted to try other flavors. This Orange flavored sounded pretty good. It has the added benefits of super anitoxidant(70% more than Good Earth's standard green tea) Japanese teas matcha and sencha. I found both the aroma and taste much lighter than the Lemongrass. The Orange gives just a hint of it's flavor. Other reviewers felt otherwise, so I would suggest to try one box first and if you like it go for this multi-pack. I do agree though that it's great for what ails ya. It's definitly one I would drink for anything from colds and sore-throats to aches and pains of all sorts. I also read that the matcha leaf helps to cleanse the body of toxins.<br /><br />This blend brews up an appealing golden shade. It gives me a renewed and refreshed feel but I also found it to be more calming than the Lemongrass which gave me quite an energy boost.It also doesn't seem to be dehydrating -as coffee can be - with more health benefits.Although I personally prefered the taste of the Lemongrass - my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - I still like this one and it is nice to have a litle variety for different moods or needs. And I don't need to add anything.<br /><br />It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffee per serving. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />From the box:<br />Ingredients: Sencha Green Tea,Orange Oil,Green Tea Extract,Natural Flavors,Matcha and Chamomile Flowers.<br /><br />Super Green Tea - 162 mg avg antioxidants per serving.<br />Good Earth Standard Green tea -108 mg avg antioxidants per serving<br /><br />So I still love that morning cup of Java, but now I look forward to my afternoon Green Tea as well.Now I would find it a disaster to be without that! I even took some with me on a recent road trip - just to be sure I had some wherever I went.<br /><br />Remember to breathe,eat healthy and...enjoy the holidays!....Laurie"

Jones,3,3,4,1344988800,Pretty good for instant coffee,"I am a serious coffee drinker, I grid my beans just before I brew the coffee, and yes, I taste the difference between burr grinder and blade grinder. Oh, yeah, I am that serious. So you probably can imagine why I have been against instant coffee for years. Becasue they normally taste aweful! Sour and chemical taste, no fragrance at all. So, when a friend told me about VIA, I giggled, called her ""one of those"" and joked about how she used coffee to flavor her milk. (I applogize! I do i do). Until one day, another friend ask me to buy instant coffee for him. I laughted at him too. But no request from a friend is too much. I bought the smallest VIA package possible, and tasted it. To my surprise, it doesn't have that sour taste, and the chemical taste was very low and can be ignored, especially if you drink your coffee with sugar (which I strongly against).<br /><br />I like the skinny long bag. when I was choosing between scissors and teeth to open the bag, the bag was teared open so easily from the top with just my fingers. Of course, that alerted me to hide it away from my toddlers. Next thing I did was no brainer, I dumped the powder into a coffee mug, and poured the hot water in it. I doubted if I really needed to stir it, but I did it anyway. The smell was not as strong as my fresh burr grinded cofee, but good enough to believe that it was coffee. I confess, I almost helded my breath when I had my first sip, ready for all sorts of aweful taste. But to my surprise, the taste was not sour at all. I had no trouble drinking the whole cup down and licked my lips and thinking ""hmm, not bad"". the second thought was ""I am only hot water away from another cup"".<br /><br />Now, here comes to final judgement:<br />For instant coffee, this is awesome! No grinder, no loud noise. You can carry it with you anywhere you go. no scissors needed. a good cup of coffee is just some hot water away. But, can it replace the old fashioned fresh grinded coffee? No, No No. Still not there yet. But I am keeping them around th house now for the time when the house needs to be dead quiet and I was craving for a cup of coffee.<br /><br />4 star because it is still not as good as fresh grinded coffee."

Once you grind your own coffee you just can never go back to coffee in a can, or certainly not instant coffee. Well, whole bean coffees are expensive in a grocery store or supermarket. I've discovered a lower-cost alternative. I pick up two or three pound containers at Trader Joe's or Costco. The Costco source is particularly interesting in that they always seem to have two or three different kinds, but the kinds seem to change on every other visit. Over the years, I've had coffees from all over the world. This latest time there was a pallet of Kirkland Signature Dark Roast Espresso Blend (with a little tag that said roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.) The aroma around the display was excellent and I couldn't resist.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the rich aroma was almost overwhelming. My wife even loved it and she isn't a coffee drinker. The coffee itself isn't all that impressive. It has a good light tasty flavor that seems mild and slightly sweet and goes down quite easily. I'd have to guess that the caffeine content was not up to the level I was used to in other whole-bean coffees and it doesn't provide that good morning jolt. I was expecting something richer and more robust, more like a dark roast. Well, this is a nice coffee, but if you're looking for something that will grow hair on your chest, this is not the one. It has a good flavor, but it's weak. I'll have no trouble finishing the bag, but I'm disappointed. The aroma was so promising and the coffee just wasn't up to it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

It contains inulin which is in the clear version of Metamucil. Only slows down absorption for an hour or two for me. Caution if eating left overs the rise is quicker. If you eat this with tomato sauce realize all tomato sauce has carbs you need to take this into account. People have said it is the acid in the tomato sauce that causes the rise, some sauces contain a lot of carbs and added sugar. These same people must have forgotten the stomach produces one of the strongest acids in nature to aid digestion so my guess is look at the carb count in the sauce for that rise. I can not believe by adding inulin which is found naturally in onions and bananas could prevent starch breakdown completely. It does seem to protect the starch to glucose breakdown but only for a couple of hours than by the third to fourth hour comes the spike. It is only tested for glucose rise for one and two hours after. Do a 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr blood meter test for your self. Many who really need to be careful with insulin spikes should check the 3rd and 4th hour to make sure it is safe. If you are on a low carb diet and you fall out of ketosis a couple hrs after eating anything get a blood glucose meter this way you can see a cause and affect from anything carb questionable you may eat. If it works for you that is great but be cautious. I am not a diabetic but follow a low carb lifestyle I get no rise at all the first hour than slow rise by the second.

The label is slightly misleading since it reads ""100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't.""

That being said, this stuff definitely does not deliver on that front. It's filled with empty calories. Sure, there's no artificial flavor or color, which is good, but the bottom line is you will still pack on the pounds if you drink this stuff often enough. Due to this, I gave it 3 stars.

198018,B0081XIASW,A11IDK9L74LPT1,C. Schmidt,10,11,2,1336176000,Good idea - implemention flawed. Maybe good for small dogs.,"I recently got this Kyjen Kibble Drop puzzle toy for our two dogs. We have a 65 lb German Shepherd Dog and a 60 lb Golden Retriever. Both have been learning ""nosework"" so I thought this would be a fun toy to add to our scenting games.  I plan to use it by dropping one yummy treat at a time and having them find and get it from one of the 4 cups.<br /><br />I'll give you my conclusion first, and then you can decide if you want to read the details below for more info (including size of the toy info).<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />I don't see how this toy could just be put on the ground and left for your dog to get the food out of the cups. Unless you have a very small dog, your dog's attempts will just move the toy around on the floor.  For larger dogs (like ours) the toy is way too lightweight and the flaps over the cups are too low to the ground for effective ""nosing the flap"" technique. In addition, any dog who couldn't nose the flap effectively would need to use her mouth -- and would naturally pick the arm up in her mouth in an attempt to get at the treats in the cup - thereby dumping all of the treats out of the other cups (hey - problem solved!!!). So, that means to play with this, you'd have to be there to hold the toy down/in-place while your dog does the puzzle and gets the treats.<br /><br />I think this toy would work best (maybe) for a small dog. Kyjen needs to make a heavier and larger sized version for medium or larger dogs.<br /><br />---------<br />.... Now, the details ....<br /><br />First, let me give you some sizing basics about this toy, so you can see if it will be a match for your dog's size.  I measured the toy and it's 10"" wide.  The top of the drop-in treat hole chamber is 4"" high. Each arm sticks out almost 4"" from the middle dispenser. Each treat cup at the end of the arm is about 2""x2"" when you lift the flap.  If you look at the very end of the arm, where the flap shuts, the height of the flap edge from the ground is under 1"".  The arms of the toy obviously slope upwards from the end, so I am talking about the very end of the arm. This is an extremely lightweight plastic toy, weighing in at just 6.2 oz.<br /><br />Whew, now that all the stats are out of the way... how is the actual puzzle toy?<br /><br />Initially, I had all the flaps open and just put a treat in an open cup so they could ""find"" it. They didn't have to open the flaps during that phase. The 2x2"" cup size is just adequate enough for them to get the treat out. If your dog is good at licking a treat out, this small size will work fine. If your dogs likes to mouth the treat out, and you have a larger dog, the 2x2 chamber size will likely be an issue. Our GSD was having trouble getting treats out because of this, although she eventually figured out how to cram her nose in there and use her tongue at the same time. :)  I would imagine a really large dog would have to be pretty good with his tongue to get a treat out of the small cups.<br /><br />An issue that appeared right away even with this simple usage was that the toy is SO lightweight it moves as soon as the dog touches it. I had to hold the toy in place or else they would just push it across the floor while trying to lick the treat out of the (flap open) cup.  I think Kyjen needs to add some weight to help keep this toy from moving so easily. The bottom has little rubber non-skid feet on each arm, but they do nothing.<br /><br />So... moving on to the phase where they had to open the flap to get the treat.... There is an issue here. For larger dogs, the flap is so low to the ground, that they can have trouble nosing it up. Our Golden tends to lie in front of what she ""finds"" when scenting. So, her head was already down on the ground level, which made it easier to work on flipping open the very-low-to-the-ground flap. Our GSD stays standing, though. So, from that angle, she couldn't really use her nose to flip the flap up (although she tried). She also used her mouth to try and open it, pawed at it, etc. I'm sure if I wasn't there to hold the toy from sliding, she would have just picked the whole thing up in her mouth -- problem solved! :)<br /><br />Now you can see why I wrote my summary above. From my experience, this is just the wrong size/weight toy for our dogs. I'll still use it for scent games, because I only need to drop one piece at a time in and I can hold the toy in place for this. But I am not sure how else this toy could be used unless you have a small dog.<br /><br />This is a hard toy to rate because of these issues. It's a good idea, but the implementation is flawed. Which is why I rated it so low.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />c-"

For 3 weeks I was on a severely strict extremely low carb diet, in hopes that it would be managed.  Unfortunately this was not the case and I was put on insulin.  Even with high doses of insulin that I am currently taking (I am now 8 months along) even some foods that are approved on my diet cause my blood sugar levels to spike.  If you have ever been on a very strict diet, you know how boring and tedious it can get because of eating the same foods over and over and seeing others eat your favorite foods while you look on in envy.  Then I happened to watch an old episode of Unwrapped on the Food Network and they did a piece on this pasta.  I was skeptical at first, who wouldn't be? But in desperation I decided to order a case of the elbow macaroni and kept my fingers crossed.  My first meal with this pasta was homemade mac and cheese.  I closed my eyes and prayed to the food gods as I took my first bite.  I was not disappointed.  In fact, I was in shock.  It tasted great, in fact, it tasted like high quality pasta. My husband scarfed down his plate in record time (having not been allowed pasta in our house for about 5 months he was almost as desperate as I was).  When I told him it was low carb pasta he scoffed and thought I was joking, but then realized I wouldn't have eaten it if it was regular pasta.  So then he tells me that ok, yes, it tasted great, but my blood sugar numbers were sure to spike really high.  I was worried about that too, but we were both wrong.  After testing my blood sugar, my numbers were even with what they had been, it was the same as if I had eaten a salad. We have not noticed any ill side effects some of the other reviewers have described, and we eat at least 2 pasta meals each week now.  I could not be happier with this product and will continue to purchase even after I have the baby because of how good it is for you.

The box was pretty beat-up, the corners seemed crushed and the walls were bending. The box was really a little too big and the bubble-padding material was either popped during shipment or not inflated when it was packed. For a product like this, it should be properly padded, as these types of carbonated beverages can explode or leak when the cans get dropped or dented.  Many of the cans were dented. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if the package was dropped or had heavier boxes on top of it.  The carrier may have had no idea what was inside, but Amazon did.<br /><br />I felt lucky that none of the beverages exploded or leaked, being that most of them were dented around the edges of the tops and bottoms.

It is just soda, but I think it deserves to arrive in new condition like any other item and not banged up.<br /><br />Overall, this product is wonderful.

So far, I have used this coffee in my espresso machine to make cappuccinos.<br /><br />First, let me comment on the crema. I was expecting more. From reading other reviews, I expected the thickest crema I'd ever seen. In fact, the crema is about the same as with most brands of coffee I use in my machine. Depending upon how fine I grind the coffee, how much coffee I use, and how tightly I pack the coffee, the crema is better or worse. This brand didn't make any noticeable difference.<br /><br />From a flavor standpoint, I find this coffee rather weak. It might be okay straight up as espresso, but once I add steamed milk, it's quite watery. I brewed it side by side with Costco's Kirkland Espresso (Starbuck's roast), and the Kirkland brand is much bolder and more intense.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a strong coffee, one with intense flavor, this isn't the coffee for you."

Other than the aftertaste, this tastes pretty good. I can pick out the different flavors of pomegranate, blackberry, honey, and tea, and they don't clash with each other. They're well blended together for the most part and this is pretty awesome with a lot of ice.<br /><br />It's just that the aftertaste ruins it. There's this slight chemical taste to the product that really interferes with the other flavors, making it so I am unable to forget that this is a powdered mix. It isn't something that would keep me from drinking the tea, but with how well everything else works together it's pretty noticeable. Again, this isn't something that I'd say would keep me from going out and purchasing it on my own, just something I hope that Lipton works on in the future.<br /><br />Aside from this, I only had one gripe that did not detract from the product itself and I didn't change the ratings for this at all. I'm just really irritated at the packaging saying that this is a 5 calorie beverage. It is, but only if you plan on using half of the packet. This is something that is standard for most companies and it's really irritating since the majority of consumers will use the entire packet and many will count the entire beverage as 5 calories when it's really 10. It's not as big of a deal here as it is with some of the more sugared products with higher calorie and carb counts, but this is sort of misleading unless you're someone who scours the nutritional and serving information on everything you buy.<br /><br />Overall though, this is something I'd probably go out and buy with my own money.<br /><br />3.4/5"

In the past, I tried many but I like the taste of this brand - comparatively speaking. In the stores, this brand often costs more than the others so this price for this quantity is a good deal. I purchased this product for a co-worker who has recently started drinking coffee. After seeing him drinking some really bad tasting and weak brands, I recommended Taster's Choice. He said he didn't know any difference in coffees. But after drinking Taster's Choice, he indeed declared that it was much better than the others. It's favorful and not too strong. Personally, I am a Starbucks, Seattle's Best and a new product line I've discovered, Joe (from Paramount Coffee Co.) coffee drinker. But, in a moment of desperation and lacking any possibility to acquire any of the above listed brands, I'd borrow some of the Taster's Choice I gifted to my co-worker."

This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories.

However, I had not fully read the ingredients before making the purchase. The good part is that it is all meat with no grains and my dog seems to have an allergy to many things which makes him finicky. BUT it has onion powder and garlic powder. Now these may make it taste better and the dog seems to enjoy but it also causes damage to his already weakened liver. Had I read the ingredients fully before even as finicky eater I would not have purchased because I know onion in any form is very dangerous to little dogs. Garlic not much better but worse for one with weakened liver already.

This is a very sweet wine with only 4-5% alcohol content. I did not expect a sweet dessert-style wine when I purchased this kit. I expected a typical Chianti. This kit does not product a typical Chianti, so if you prefer light/sweet wine you will like this kit.

119823,B0009YUEG2,AF8SREA2XE7BJ,M. Karazim,4,5,4,1290988800,"Good, but........","In the search for a more natural and less waste-producing cat litter, I stumbled upon Feline Pine.  Since I could not find an official Feline Pine cat box to use with it, I decided to try the Tidy Cats Breeze litter box.  My cat seemed to like Feline Pine just fine, and the Breeze box seemed fine, too.  At first.<br /><br />As for the litter itself, the true subject of this review, I really like it.  I especially like that you can actually flush the cat poop down your toilet, since the pellets dissolve into sawdust when they are wet.  Although the pellets did seem to stick to the poop, it was still really easy to scoop out of the box and dispose of.  I didn't notice much tracking beyond a very close perimeter of the box, probably due more to her attempting to bury her waste than to the pellets sticking to her paws.  No tracking upstairs as with the old clumping clay litter, no ""litter box feet"" smell on the actual cat, and no more licking clay litter dust when she is grooming.  The odor of the box is not horrible, but it certainly doesn't mask the poop odor like clumping litter.  I didn't buy it for that purpose, and my box is in the basement, so no big deal.  The smell wasn't intolerable, just kind of funky.  Wet sawdust meets cat urine meets poop.  And, this litter is pretty reasonable and lasts quite a long time, in my opinion longer than a tub of clumping litter because you don't use as much in the box.  Ultimately, the litter is a great product if you have a proper box to use it with.<br /><br />Now, for the box.  I read many reviews where people mentioned using the Breeze box with Feline Pine.  And it does work.  Kind of.  The wet sawdust falls into the tray below and the tray can be emptied into the trash.  The solid waste stays on top.  Every time I scooped the poop I'd sift the box, bringing the dust down to the tray.  Then I would dump the tray and I was done.  Very simple.  The problem is that every once in awhile you really do need to clean the box.  I don't mean scoop, I mean clean, with actual soap and water.  The tray gets rather nasty with all that urine-soaked sawdust falling down there (sometimes I'd even have standing puddles of urine waiting when I pulled out the tray) and would benefit from a soap and water cleansing about once a month.  So begins the nightmare.  The box is hard to clean with this litter in it!  The pellets get stuck in the sifting grid, and I don't have a utility sink in my laundry room, so I hauled the box upstairs to the tub to try to ""rinse"" them out.  The pellets dissolve in water, right?  No, they don't dissolve!  They turn into sawdust!  Big mistake.  Don't be foolish like I was and try to put Feline Pine sawdust down your tub drain.  Duh!  It clogs the drain!  I ended up with a bunch of sawdust in my tub, which I then had to plunge out of the drain and scoop out with my hands.  Disgusting.  I should really have tried picking them out first and then washing the box.  Live and learn.  Either way, it is a huge pain to soap-and-water cleanse the box.<br /><br />I am deducting a star because Feline Pine makes a box specifically for this litter, but it's not available!  I guess you could use a regular box, but that seems an even worse option.  You'd have a ton of soggy sawdust sitting on the bottom, and the cat would end up digging in that.  Gross.<br /><br />Feline Pine, I need a decent box for this litter!"

Bizarrely enough, I don't find that it tastes strongly of either of its eponymous fruits; the flavors seem to have fused  into something else altogether. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a bit odd (bear in mind that taste is a very personal sense and that this is just my opinion).<br />What prevents me from awarding a full five stars isn't its flavor, however. Yes, it's sweetened with fruit juice, but an 8.3 oz. (where do they come up with these amounts?) serving weighs in at at whopping 140 calories--the same as a 12 oz. can of my lovingly hoarded ""kosher for Passover"" Coca Cola. It also contains 36 g of carbohydrates, 35 of which are from sugar. Granted, it contains 100% of the RDA of Vitamin C, but so does a supplement tablet, with no calories. So I really can't recommend this for those who are concerned about their weight or blood sugar.<br />Amazon currently carries this at &lt;$1/can with free shipping, which sounds about right. Were I to encounter this in a store, I might be tempted to pay $1/can but not on a regular basis; there's just not enough product there to justify the cost for me and the flavor's not remarkable enough.

Is it Too Good to be True?,"Celsius Raspberry Acai Green Tea beverage is a decent- flavored beverage loaded with nutrition, with minimal calories, low sodium, and none of the bad qualities that make so many other beverages so unappealing. Oh, and one other thing: The manufacturer claims that consuming this beverage will help you burn extra calories. This product is decent in flavor, with the light taste of green tea backed with a small amount of raspberry and some medicinal properties. It is non- cabonated, smooth, and as easy to consume as a glass of water.<br /><br />The key difference between this and your average green tea beverage is the calorie- burning claim. The manufacturer claims that this beverage helps you burn about one- hundred calories per can and when you consider that there are only about ten calories in each serving, it would therefore mean that consuming this beverage will actually result in negative calories. This almost sounds too good to be true, but a quick examination of the ingredients makes it easier to understand why this is possible. This product contains added stimulants in the form of caffeine and taurine. These stimulants will give your metabolism a boost, and this extra metabolism will likely lead to added caloric loss. The manufacturer is cautious when it makes this claim, pointing out that results are best when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise. I can see how this drink could contribute to some extra caloric expenditure, due to the added boost of energy, but like the manufacturer claims, it takes more than ingesting stimulants to lose weight. You still need to control your eating habits and exercise for maximum effect.<br /><br />The added stimulants could discourage some people from trying this beverage, but another potential turn- off is the price. Purchasing a couple of cases of this product would be almost as expensive as buying an inexpensive piece of exercise equipment. Unless I was seriously into losing weight and wanted any little bit of help I could get, I am not so sure this product would be worth the money.<br /><br />Still, when all things are considered, Celsius Raspberry Acai Green Tea is a good beverage that is worth trying. The nutrition is much better than that found in most beverages and the taste, while it does have an artificial sweetener finish, is pleasant nonetheless. I'm a little cautious about consuming anything that contains multiple stimulants and increases my heart rate, but this is still a good product; better than the vast majority of beverages on the market and certainly worth trying if you're looking for a liquid fitness companion."

An hour later I am nearly finished with the entire bottle! For me, that is amazing, lol.  I am really enjoying the way the water tastes (or lack of taste, whichever the case may be, lol)  I can honestly say that I will hopefully be purchasing more bottles of this in the very near future.

Of course for anyone with health issues, I don't recommend bars at all, since they, by design, have too much sweetener in them.  American society can't seem to purchase anything that isn't sweetened, or is it that American food industry won't make anything that isn't sweetened.  The challenge even with the rise bar is that it is sweetened with Agave (and a bit too much).  Depending on the source of agave (specifically how much the provider has processed it), agave ""nector"" could have been turned into High Fructose syrup.  And, the rise bar doesn't need that much sweetener.  I think they are trying to make it taste like a sni***** candy bar (to sweet).  The rice already provides soe sweetness and perhaps some stevia or luo han guo extract would do well to give a nice taste.  And, since such a minimal amount would be required, it might even make the manufacturing cheaper once they modified the lines.  Who knows.  I just wish that companies like this would lead nutrition trends a bit more aggressively.  All the ingredients are nutritious, except the Agave (likely), by themselves, so start buying into the sweet-tooth brain-washing!

This doesn't include all of the weekly trips to the coffee shop while at work for more specialized drinks.  Most of our home coffee is whole bean Colombian which we grind in a Krups espresso machine and coffee maker.  We're generally not terribly adventurous with our coffee choices so we were more than happy to give Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee a try.  Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Organic and Fair Trade.<br /><br />+ Pleasant aromatic smell.<br /><br />+ Works great in a French Press.<br /><br />+ Great for travel.<br /><br />+ Appealing packaging and good overall message.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Tastes more like coffee flavored water than real coffee.<br /><br />- No instructions on or in the box on how to brew properly.<br /><br />- Improvisation may be necessary if you don't have a pod brewer.  We used a French Press which worked really well.<br /><br />- Flavors may not be for everyone.<br /><br />Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee is a great concept but really fails to deliver on taste.  The first issue arises with the product being in pods.  Many people don't use pod machines.  We used a French Press which worked amazingly well but the pods won't work well in a standard coffee maker.  Our second issue was the lack of overall flavor.

142064,B003GTR8IO,A13MKSASQ6YWL7,Brad Willis,1,2,4,1290297600,Here's what many aren't understanding about this coffee,"They aren't understanding that the vanilla flavor is *supposed* to be subtle.  If you don't believe me, just read the bag because it states this quite clearly.  I've seen many reviews where the reviewer is dinging the rating because the flavor is subtle and that's not fair in my opinion because that's what Starbucks is trying to accomplish.  And for those who say that there is no vanilla flavor, I strongly disagree.  It's there but it's subtle, which is the entire idea here folks.<br /><br />Along those same likes, I thought I'd compare the subtle flavors of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee to the more pronounced flavors of the Melitta Pariaian Vanilla coffee.  So I brewed two cups and then sampled each side-by-side.  Following are my impressions of each coffee.<br /><br />Cost: While prices change all of the time, as of this writing, Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee is selling for $0.59 per ounce.  The Melitta Parisian Vanilla Coffee is selling for $0.58 per ounce.  So in essence, the price is roughly the same between the two.<br /><br />Color/Roast: The color looks about the same between the two.  It's a medium roast or roughly a city roast for those who know what that means.  In the past I've felt as if Starbucks overroasts some of their coffee.  Fortunately, that does not appear to be the case with their Natural Vanilla Coffee.<br /><br />Grind: The grind is also about the same.  Melitta calls it an extra fine grind but both are probably somewhere between a fine grind and an extra fine grind.  I brewed both cups in my Jura S7 espresso machine in the Cafe Americano style, which is basically hot water added to a shot or two of espresso.<br /><br />Aroma in the bag: Starbucks mostly smells like very good quality coffee.  The scent of vanilla is present but subtle.  What vanilla scent is there is reminds one of  fresh and natural ingredients.  The Melitta has more of a pronounced vanilla scent.  The Melitta's scent is pleasant but slightly artificial to my nose.<br /><br />Aroma in the cup: The vanilla scent is very subtle with respect to Starbucks Natural Vanilla.  The Melitta Parisian Vanilla has a stronger, but not overpowering scent.  There's more vanilla scent in the Melitta cup to be sure.<br /><br />Flavor: Both coffees are very pleasant, although I'd characterize Starbucks Natural Vanilla as being a very good quality coffee with a subtle hint of vanilla versus Melitta's Parisian Vanilla coffee being a vanilla-flavored coffee, if that makes sense.  While I still like and recommend the Melitta, I think I like it a little bit less now that I've tried the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee.  That's because the Starbucks brew has a fresher and more natural aroma and flavor.  But again, the Starbucks coffee is far more subtle than the Melitta coffee.  For some, that will be a good thing and others will undoubtedly wish for a more forward vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients: The Starbucks Natural Vanilla lists their ingredients as ""Ground Coffee, Natural Flavors, Ground Vanilla Beans & Indian Sarsaparilla Root"" (with Corn Maltodextrin & Vegetable Glycerin added).  Melitta doesn't tell you what's in their blend.  I visited Melitta's website in an effort to determine what sort of ingredients are used to flavor their Parisian Vanilla.  They use words like ""rich"" and ""smooth and creamy"", but nothing more specific that I could find.  So I am going to assume that Starbucks uses ingredients that I would consider to be of a superior quality to the ingredients used to flavor the Melitta Parisian Vanilla.<br /><br />Recommendations: One thing that I like to do is to buy non-flavored beans and simply add a teaspoon or tablespoon of fresh vanilla to a cup of non-flavored beans.  So this is also an option.  If you go this route, use only real vanilla and not the artificial stuff.  Now with respect to these flavored coffees, they're both very good.  Tasting the two coffees side-by-side gave me a good opportunity to compare the two.  While I still like the Melitta Parisian Vanilla, I prefer the subtle character and fresh ingredients of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee.  If you prefer a coffee with a more pronounced but not overpowering vanilla flavor, go with Melitta.  If you prefer a well-balanced coffee with a subtle but fresh and natural vanilla flavor, you might prefer the Starbucks version.  If you're not sure, consider trying each and decide for yourself, as they're not terribly expensive.  But in the end, I do think that they are both very good."

Makes a very strong small cup.  Perfect would be 2 pods, one cup, one brewed on short and the other on medium.<br /><br />As for the flavor of the beans, they produce a full bodied, bold and bitter cup.  Not necessarily a bad bitter, as it is pure arabica, however, I personally wouldn't recommend having more than one cup of these a day.

(2) This enables one to make powdered sugar (just add 1 TB arrowroot powder or tapioca starch per 1 cup finely blended coconut sugar).  Then coconut sugar can be used to make icing and the like.  (3) Sweetened condensed milk can also be made. (See allrecipes.com's recipe for regular sweetened condensed milk.  Ingredients are: 1 1/8 powdered milk, 1/2 cup water, 3/4 cup coconut sugar, blended to a fine consistency.)  It isn't all that pretty (beige color) but it makes wonderful lemon bars.<br /><br />Coconut sugar doesn't taste exactly like cane sugar (more maple-y and hearty), but there is no sugar crash since it has a low glycemic index of 35 (lower than apples and carrots).  It is loaded with potassium, along with nitrogen, zinc, magnesium and several vitamin Bs (as opposed to agave syrup, which is fairly empty of any nutritional value).<br /><br />Additionally, this price that Amazon offers is less than my co-op's bulk price."

Delivery unproblematic: fulfilled by ""Amazon LLC.""; seems of good quality; came very fast. Like Barlean's flax oil, it comes in a non-trasparent-black, squeezable, very soft plastic bottle with a valve in the spout. The bottle is sealed under the cap: you gotta unscrew the cap and peel off the seal before you can use it. Press date is in September, which is a bit old, but otoh, hemp oil isn't as perishable as flax oil, so maybe it's OK.<br /><br />Since I've just learned of the purported health benefits of this oil, I can only comment on the taste of it: on the bottle, and here, and elsewhere online, hempseed oil is said to have a really nice, ""nutty"" flavour. Well, not true: actually, it's more medicinal/grassy, reminiscent of rosemary. Not unpleasant, but nothing special -- actually, flax is marginally better (though I don't particularly like it either). I suspect that were it not for their purported healthfulness, no one would use either of these oils. But supposedly they're good, so we'll see. Unlike flax oil (which has some solids floating in it and needs to be shaken up before use), hemp oil has a homogeneous consistency -- like any other cooking oil, except for the colour: a sort of of luminous green, believe it or not; quite a bit like antifreeze. So these are my initial impressions; I'll update this review if I discover anything noteworthy as I use it.<br /><br />12/28/10: I have to bring the stars down: the taste is horrible; in a matter of days I've grown to hate it -- it's like a greasy medicine of some sort, an emetic. There's _nothing_ it's good with, it SPOILS the taste of anything you add it to. Why do health foods taste so bad? Are they really healthful or it's just hype 'cause the maker wants to sell it? I really can't recommend this product (though it was delivered fine, and in good packaging, so the manufacturing part is fine; just the oil itself is horrible). Flax oil is far less disgusting.<br /><br />01/08/2011: Just poured the remaining half-bottle down the toilet. A solemn moment of personal liberation. Healthful my as."

I tried flipping the treat over so it points in as suggested by other reviewers and that lasted another 5 minutes or so. Then I jammed it completely inside the ball. That bought me another 5 minutes. I eventually had to take the treat away because he was eating it too fast. It later affected his digestion in a less than pleasant way. The treat is kind of gross-- it smells bad and leaves significant residue on the floor, dog bed, etc. I'm sorry I wasted the money on buying two (ridiculously expensive) replacement treats before knowing what I was getting into. That said, the ball itself is good for other things. I find that stuffing treats, frozen fruit, etc. inside of it keeps my dog occupied for much longer than the treat itself did. He spends more time with this ball than with any of the Kong toys he has, even the Kong Genius ones. I've also started feeding him his kibble shoved inside the ball.

On the positive side, there was no excess packaging, the treats arelow calorie, gluten free  and safe/healthy for your dog if given in the recommended amounts and even for dogs on strict diets.  There's a nice cinnamon smell that's appealing to humans.  Both my dogs appeared to enjoy this treat and were eager for a second once they ate the first, so in addition to the positive aspects for a cautious owner, it was also popular with the intended audience.<br /><br />However, I'd also caveat this with a few other issues.  First, the package says a medium dog could get 2 sticks per day.  There are six sticks in a bag and the cost is $6 - that's fairly pricey given that my dogs (admittedly expert, hardy chewers) ate their sticks in less than 5 minutes.  While the cinnamon scent is appealing to humans, one of my dogs didn't seem excited about it at first.  She did decide to eat it after a couple minutes (she initially put it down and backed away), but only because the other dog expressed interest.  Once she ate the first one, she seemed more than willing to take another, but there was an initial hesitation.  I'd expected something that might take longer to chew through.  I'm the first to admit my dogs are super-chewers, so if your dog doesn't have jaws of steel, you might get more out of this treat, but it took between 2 -4 minutes (depending on which of the dogs) to eat the strips.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't mind the price, it's not a bad treat."

For the record, I am the owner of a coffee roastery and a cafe which has won ""Coffee Bar of the Year"" for the past 4 years in CT. We roast coffee for other cafes as well so I feel I have a pretty good grasp of what a good coffee should taste like. Here's my impression of Via:<br /><br />It is certainly easy to prepare. I generally drink a 16oz coffee so I used 2 packets (they are sized for an 8oz serving) to prepare my cup. The coffee is ready to drink as soon as it is stirred.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black and what I taste is only the coffee (my preference for brewing water is a neutral pH of 7, a Langelier Index of zero and no chlorine, fluoride, or lime).<br /><br />On to the coffee:  A good Colombian should be very balanced, with good body, brightness* and a nutty flavor. Truth be told, most Colombian coffee on the market is a bit boring, and most are at best a simply decent, clean cup with almost no aftertaste. Unfortunately this is only true if it's fresh** from a roaster which is unlikely.<br />The Via Colombian that I tried might have started out as an Arabica coffee from the low end of the Specialty Coffee spectrum. Since I don't know the timeline for production, it is very difficult to say how old the coffee was to begin with but there is definitely a ""woody"" note that I associate with aged beans. The actual flavor might not be terrible if you where able to separate out this woody note but unfortunately Via has a very objectionable mouth feel and aftertaste. After a few seconds, there is a very noticeable residue left on your tongue that is bitter and astringent. I typically associate this with a brew that has had coffee grounds siting in it such as when a coffee filter collapses while brewing.<br /><br />Bottom line for me: I would drink it only if my only other choice was a widely available and well known ""donut"" shop coffee (which I am mystified why anyone would drink...just terrible). As for the flavored versions of Via, I am really not a fan of ANY flavored coffee since these flavorings are typically unhealthy and serve mostly to mask the objectionable tastes of the coffee. I drink coffee because I like the flavor. This was my second tasting of Via. I tried it when it was first released in 2009 and was hoping to see an improvement but my notes from that tasting are very similar. I really think that a high end instant is a good idea, but unfortunately for me, Via misses the mark.<br /><br />For a quick and relatively convenient cup, I would suggest investing $30 in an ""AeroPress"" made by Aerobie and widely available. Armed with a freshly roasted coffee from your local micro roaster, you get a tasty, easy to prepare cup, and a very simple cleanup..<br /><br />* We use the descriptive term ""acidity"" to describe brightness. This is not to be confused with the often heard term ""acidic"" which people lament about a coffee that upsets their stomachs. This is thought of by many people in the industry to be the result contamination of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, molds, fungus, and other contaminants often found in non-specialty grade coffee. We believe that most of these complaints would disappear simply by trying a better quality coffee.<br />** Fresh = less than two weeks from roasting. Most coffee is WAY beyond this timeline...."

I found that I need more than 6 to 8 ounces of water due to the concentration in each of the packets.<br />It's very nice that each packet is individually sealed, which keeps it fresh for quite a while.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's very high in sugar. It's a peppery, sugary drink. I believe it will supply you with the necessary amounts of ginger to affect your health in a positive way. Here's the but though, because it's high in sugar, it's something that someone like I, who have higher than normal cholesterol would not want to consume too much off.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I liked the taste, but would prefer less sugar, or artificial sweetener. Perhaps sweetened with honey?"

At first I was happy to see that he spent some time chewing on it. We all went to bed, and all was fine, until 4:00 am, when we were awoken by Rocco throwing up his dinner. An hour later, he proceeded to throw up blood, a large amount of blood. Soon after, he threw up blood again. We rushed him to the vet, and the vet said that this product was way too hard for a puppy that young. We were surprised to hear this because the package stated that the product was designed for puppies 6 months or older, and Rocco was double the suggested weight limit. He said this product should not be given to dogs until they are more than a year old. The product, when chewed, became sharp shards, that tore up his digestive tract.

It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio, you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...<br /><br />However, my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.<br /><br />The mold is white, it reminds me of bread fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten.

I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring!

Needless to say, I was unimpressed with it.  I had all but written Gloria Jean off as a weak coffee brand when my boyfriend's sister gave us a few of her Butter Toffee k cups to try out, insisting they were much better than the Hazelnut.  At that point I hadn't tried another butter toffee flavored coffee from any of the other brands, so I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />What a letdown.<br /><br />Butter toffee does smell like its namesake when it is being brewed.  I had a lot of hope for it because of how it made my kitchen smell during the brewing process.  The flavor follow-up was nothing short of weak, though.  For one thing, I couldn't detect any butter toffee flavor in the coffee itself at all.  Shame.  The other downside is that, instead of being just a slightly boring, but good cup of regular coffee, this one somehow managed to be bitter and weak at the same time.  Nothing robust or flavorful about it.  Just weak coffee with a terrible aftertaste.<br /><br />So I've only had the chance to try two of Gloria Jean's flavors so far, but I definitely won't be going out of my way to try any others.

290994,B005HG9ESG,A2AWVROFGSZU4E,My Fake Name,0,1,4,1346284800,Not for giraffe-rinsing,"****<br /><br />For several years I have been seriously studying various bottled waters, and after researching this particular one quite thoroughly I have reached a number of conclusions, which I will now reveal for free despite the fact these tests have cost me a lot of time and money over the years.<br /><br />First, it's mostly water.  In fact, it is for all practical purposes all water.<br /><br />According to my high-quality, thoroughly calibrated pH meter, which I reviewed elsewhere, the alkalinity of this particular bottle of water is much closer to 9.3 than 9.5, but that's only 2.105% lower, which I think makes no difference unless you drink dozens of gallons a day and dozens more a night, which if you do might come you down with hyponatremia.<br /><br />This water has a particular taste both in the mouth during drinking and afterwards.  Unlike trying to describe exactly how a wine tastes - ""An insouciant trace of dried foxglove petals masked almost but not completely by overarching reminiscences of the mature essences of oak barrels and lightly smoked hedgehog droppings,"" you know what I mean - trying to describe how the product under review tastes is simpler.<br /><br />Water.<br /><br />It tastes like water.<br /><br />It tastes like water as you're drinking it.<br /><br />After you've finished drinking some and you wait awhile to see whether there's any degree of afterbirth, there isn't.  It's exactly as though you had drunk water.  Which you had.<br /><br />****<br /><br />It freezes at 31.875 degrees Fahrenheit.  It boils at 210.77 degrees, not the 212 you might have expected, because I conducted the testing at 720 feet above MSL, but the point is that the boiling point of pure water at 720 feet up is 210.76 degrees.<br /><br />****<br /><br />It puts out a campfire just as well as tap water, and it puts out a campfire just as well as bottled water that doesn't contain sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, which is alkaline, which raises the pH level), dipotassium phosphate (derived exclusively from meteorites), magnesium sulfate (found only in certain caves in the Lesser Antilles islands), and calcium chloride (essence of limestone).<br /><br />****<br /><br />Amazon Vine Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, (Pack of 12), when bought in that quantity, amounts to 18 liters of water, which is 4.7551 gallons if you merely type ""18 liters in gallons "" into Google, which weighs 39.701 pounds, which is extremely close to the 39 pounds 11 ounces you would expect from pure water according to Wolfram when you enter ""18 liters water in pounds.""<br /><br />It works well in a squirt gun, which I still think more people should carry around just in case.<br /><br />At room temperature Essentia works well as a rinse after you've shampooed your hamster or your parakeet, and it works just as well after you've shampooed your giraffe but it takes a lot more, which gets expensive compared to just using tap water through a garden hose, believe you me.

The ""dust"" makes my dog cough even if he eats slowly; adding a little water to his bowl has helped with this issue.<br /><br />Edited to add: I've added a photo so you can see what winds up in the bowl.<br /><br />Since this was my first bag of ZiwiPeak I'm not sure if this is normal for the brand - at this cost though I feel it shouldn't be. It could be that the product had settled and the heavy weight of the upper product caused the lower portion to settle and break, or maybe this bag just had a really rough time in shipping.

On what pieces were not completely incinerated you were lucky to have maybe 1-2 actual peanuts, These were caramelized and stale like the rest of the product reminiscent of something your grandmother put out  when surprised by an unexpected distant relative.<br /><br />Now it is possible - that The Peanut Company of Virginias has one employee who suffers from an extreme peanut allergy as to only be able to toss in 11 peanuts into the brittle mix before having to run for their inhaler and in running coincidentally tripped and crushed the box of brittle... and in his dismay, hid the box for 4 years in shame before it was accidentally found and used to fulfill my order.

Although the peppers are not identified on the label I am guessing New Mexican red and cayenne (this product is made in the US, by the way).

The packaging says it is a healthy substitute for butter, and can be used as a spread.  My mouth watered at the idea of a bit of this, some nutella, and a banana wrapped up in a whole grain wrap.  The potential here was exciting for someone who loves coconut like I do.<br /><br />The packaging indicated that the oil separates from the coconut, and you must put the container in hot water for five to ten minutes for everything to soften, so that you can stir it all up to a nice smooth consistency.  Sound pretty easy right?  Wrong.  I found after leaving the container in a bowl of hot water for 10 minutes, it was still too hard to stir.  It took three rounds of hot water bath-vigorous stir cycle to get this to wear I could use it.  I tasted it, and was sad that it did not taste nearly as good as I anticipated.  It also had a weird gritty texture, and overall I was not crazy about it.<br /><br />Since clearly this was not going to work as a spread for me, I instead used while cooking mulligatawny soup.  I had created a low fat version of the soup without butter, cream, or milk, so the coconut manna helped add a bit of richness to it.  However, it is still a bit high in calories to be something I would use daily.  I will probably continue using olive oil for much of my cooking, but I do plan on experimenting with the coconut manna when making smoothies, sauces, desserts, and ethnic dishes.  It did nicely in my soup.<br /><br />I am not completely sold on coconut manna, but I am not ready to give up on it either."

Or a bed pillow, assuming you could sleep through the crackling.  To appreciate this product you should be fairly adept with a tea ball (schlepping a generous teaspoon of the mint leaves into a metal container with holes in it and dunking it all in a very hot cup of water), You also need a bit of patience (to allow it to steep 5 minutes) and a fair amount of imagination.

Frankly, that's a stretch.<br /><br />I would not buy this product, unless you intend to make 'iced' mint herbal tea, hot herbal mint tea, mint ice cubes, and some kind of mint salve.

His classmate used paper mache and he's using Celluclay.<br /><br />A few things to remember and consider: Don't add too much water or the project will take forever and a day to dry.  My son's rock took more than a week to dry.  Also, mix it outside and use a dust mask.  It is extremely lightweight and powdery.  I made the mistake of not using a dust mask the first time I mixed it and accidentally inhaled the dust.  It's awful.

While I have to admit that it's a bit on the dry side, the flavor is unusual but not unplesant.  And the dryness might actually be a very good sign: it means that they didn't add a lot of oil or butter to moisten it up...just eat it with a glass of milk or water/tea/coffee, I suppose.  No biggy...the pros still far far outweigh the cons:<br /><br />Because like the rest of the Bear Valley bars, it is a complete protein and has an unbeatable dollars-per-calorie value. I'm a very physically-active male with a high metabolism, yet I really CAN eat this bar as a meal replacement, it keeps me feeling full but never bloated or gassy (unlike many others) for a good 3-5 hours...that would normally require at least two ClifBars or at least 3 of a cheap grocery store granola bar. Anyway, if you just need a little snack to tie you over for an hour or so, have just half of a bar at a time.<br /><br />I've also eaten 1/4 to 1/3 of these bars at a time just before a long run or during (about every 45 minutes) a long run, and with no ill effects stomach-wise. That, in my opinion, is a good testament to its digestibility and quality, organic ingredients.<br /><br />The only TINY gripe I have about these bars is that it's damn near impossible to tear open the wrapper with your bare hands unless you take something sharp and slash a hole first...so I just use a pair of scissors, quick and easy.
